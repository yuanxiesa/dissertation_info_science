In these domains, data changes over time, so a non-static analysis is required to obtain feasible solutions. In this type of environments, MOGAs are often time-consuming and require special adaptation to work properly. A number of different techniques have been proposed to adapt MOGAs to dynamic environments for tackling the previous problems such as hypermutation, memory and immigrant schemes or multi-population methods, among others. In particular, immigrant strategies are one of the most commonly used methods, for that reason, this work proposes a new methodology that allows to make a detailed evaluation of their performance when these strategies are used. The proposed methodology works on two levels, a coarse-grain one and a fine-grain one. In the former, an overall evaluation of the different immigrant strategies is made based on three different dimensions: Quality, Stability and Speed. In the latter, a detailed study of the status of the immigrant individuals during the evolution of the algorithm is carried out. This is a very relevant aspect to take into account in order to evaluate whether an immigrant strategy is working properly or not. To deploy this methodology, a new visualization technique for population mixing analysis is proposed in this work. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a test case in the context of the Dynamic Community Detection problem (DCD) has been selected using a MOGA that applies several different immigrant schemes, showing both how the methodology works and how it could be employed in a particular dynamic problem.","[Panizo-Lledot, Angel; Bello-Orgaz, Gema; Camacho, David] Tech Univ Madrid, Comp Syst Engn Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pedemonte, Martin] Univ Republica, Inst Comp, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay","Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Panizo-Lledot, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Comp Syst Engn Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain.",angel.panizo@upm.es,"Pedemonte, Martín/H-8249-2013; Camacho, David/B-5779-2014; , Gema/C-8170-2014","Pedemonte, Martín/0000-0002-8348-0921; Camacho, David/0000-0002-5051-3475; , Gema/0000-0003-2826-3286","XAI-DisInfodemics [PLEC2021-007681]; FightDIS [PID2020-117263GB-100]; ERDF (a way of making Europe); European Union; European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19; BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19; European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub [2020-EU-IA-0252]; ANII [MOV_CA_2019_1_156657]; CSIC, UDELAR, at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid through Convenio Plurianual; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]","XAI-DisInfodemics; FightDIS; ERDF (a way of making Europe)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); European Union(European Union (EU)); European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR(European Union (EU)); Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19; BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19; European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub; ANII; CSIC, UDELAR, at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid through Convenio Plurianual; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid;","This work was supported in part by the XAI-DisInfodemics under Grant PLEC2021-007681, in part by the FightDIS under Grant PID2020-117263GB-100, in part by Grant MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, in part by ERDF (a way of making Europe), in part by the European Union, in part by the European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR, in part by the Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19, in part by BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and in part by the European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub under Grant 2020-EU-IA-0252.

However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey, we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph self-supervised learning. Latest advances in graph SSL are summarized in a GitHub repository https://github.com/LirongWu/awesome-graph-self-supervised-learning.","[Wu, Lirong; Lin, Haitao; Tan, Cheng; Gao, Zhangyang; Li, Stan Z.] Westlake Univ, Sch Engn, AI Lab, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China",Westlake University,"Li, SZ (corresponding author), Westlake Univ, Sch Engn, AI Lab, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.",wulirong@westlake.edu.cn; linhaitao@westlake.edu.cn; tancheng@westlake.edu.cn; gaozhangyang@westlake.edu.cn; stan.zq.li@westlake.edu.cn,"Li, SY/JPK-3839-2023; Huang, Yu/KDM-9182-2024","Li, SY/0009-0000-9254-7115; WU, Lirong/0000-0001-5551-3194",,,,,90,45,47,19,65,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1041-4347,1558-2191,,IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN,IEEE Trans.

Neighborhood density between nodes is one of the fundamental indicators of community presence in the network. A community with a high edge density will have correlations between nodes that extend beyond their immediate neighbors, denoted by motifs. Motifs are repetitive patterns of edges observed with high frequency in the network. We proposed the PCDMS method (Probabilistic Community Detection with Motif Structure) that detects communities by estimating the triangular motif in the network. This study employs structural density between nodes, a key concept in graph analysis. The proposed model has the advantage of using a probabilistic generative model that calculates the latent parameters of the probabilistic model and determines the community based on the likelihood of triangular motifs. The relationship between observing two pairs of nodes in multiple communities leads to an increasing likelihood estimation of the existence of a motif structure between them. The output of the proposed model is the intensity of each node in the communities. The efficiency and validity of the proposed method are evaluated through experimental work on both synthetic and real-world networks; the findings will show that the community identified by the proposed method is more accurate and dense than other algorithms with modularity, NMI, and F1score evaluation metrics.","[Hajibabaei, Hossein; Seydi, Vahid; Koochari, Abbas] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Seydi, Vahid] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Wales",Islamic Azad University; Bangor University,"Seydi, V (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.;Seydi, V (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Wales.",h.hajibabaei@srbiau.ac.ir; V.seydi@bangor.ac.uk; koochari@srbiau.ac.ir,"Seydi, Vahid/KHZ-7414-2024",,,,,,54,0,0,10,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9902,1573-7675,,J INTELL INF SYST,J.

While most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network. Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial differences in community detection such as users' tendencies toward preferential attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect of users' location and primary programming language, which was determined using a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts and network scholars interested in studying team formation.","[Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz] James Madison Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Kramer, Brandon L.; Calderon, J.

The tempo of somite formation is controlled by a molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock(1,2). Although this oscillator has been well-characterized in model organisms(1,2), whether a similar oscillator exists in humans remains unknown. Genetic analyses of patients with severe spine segmentation defects have implicated several human orthologues of cyclic genes that are associated with the mouse segmentation clock, suggesting that this oscillator might be conserved in humans(3). Here we show that human PSM cells derived in vitro-as well as those of the mouse(4)-recapitulate the oscillations of the segmentation clock. Human PSM cells oscillate with a period two times longer than that of mouse cells (5 h versus 2.5 h), but are similarly regulated by FGF, WNT, Notch and YAP signalling(5). Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that mouse and human PSM cells in vitro follow a developmental trajectory similar to that of mouse PSM in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FGF signalling controls the phase and period of oscillations, expanding the role of this pathway beyond its classical interpretation in 'clock and wavefront' models(1). Our work identifying the human segmentation clock represents an important milestone in understanding human developmental biology. Human presomitic mesoderm cells derived in vitro demonstrate oscillations of the segmentation clock, thus providing a window into an otherwise inaccessible stage of human development.","[Diaz-Cuadros, Margarete; Budjan, Christoph; Hubaud, Alexis; Tarazona, Oscar A.; Donelly, Sophia; Michaut, Arthur; Al Tanoury, Ziad; Pourquie, Olivier] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Diaz-Cuadros, Margarete; Budjan, Christoph; Hubaud, Alexis; Tarazona, Oscar A.; Donelly, Sophia; Michaut, Arthur; Al Tanoury, Ziad; Pourquie, Olivier] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wagner, Daniel E.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yoshioka-Kobayashi, Kumiko; Kageyama, Ryoichiro] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Life & Med Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Niino, Yusuke; Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN Ctr Brain Sci, Lab Cell Funct & Dynam, Saitama, Japan; [Touboul, Jonathan] Brandeis Univ, Dept Math, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Touboul, Jonathan] Brandeis Univ, Volen Natl Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA USA; [Pourquie, Olivier] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Kyoto University; RIKEN; Brandeis University; Brandeis University; Harvard University,"Pourquié, O (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Pourquié, O (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Pourquié, O (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Miyawaki, Atsushi/KGK-3647-2024; Pourquié, Olivier/CAJ-5443-2022; Miyawaki, Atsushi/K-3569-2014","Miyawaki, Atsushi/0000-0001-6126-1464; Pourquié, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227; Yoshioka-Kobayashi, Kumiko/0009-0004-7225-2693; Budjan, Christoph/0000-0002-1563-9750; Touboul, Jonathan/0000-0003-1366-0414; Hubaud, Alexis/0000-0003-1249-4282; Kageyama, Ryoichiro/0000-0002-5985-1120; Diaz Cuadros, Margarete/0000-0002-1459-3957; MICHAUT, Arthur/0000-0003-1226-0021; Wagner, Daniel/0000-0002-2983-635X","National Institute of Health [5R01HD085121, 1K99GM121852]; NSF GRFP; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [F31HD100033] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"We thank members of the Pourquie laboratory, D.

However, this topic has not been investigated in detail. This study, first, deploys science mapping techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output, impact, and structure of the Colombian scientific elite, i.e., researchers awarded with the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize 1990-2020, known locally as the Colombian Nobel. Second, we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990-2020 via the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al. Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases. The Colombian scientific elite also showed positive growth, which is an inverse trend compared with the sample of Nobel laureate productivity. There were no noticeable changes in productivity/impact before and after receiving the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize. Institutional collaboration within the Colombian scientific elite displayed the highest betweenness (brokerage) role of world/local top-tier universities. However, only two Colombian scientific elite members published an article with two Nobel Prize laureates. Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities, but were found to diverge from the national focus in respect of strategic research capacities. The interleaving of the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates-particularly between the 3(rd) and 2(nd) quartiles-enabled a more nuanced analysis of the local impact in the global scientific landscape. Our findings also contrast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America, despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals, and also shed light on the research performance-impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in-context assessment of outstanding local research.","[Cortes, Julian D.] Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Julian D.] Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cortes, Julian D.] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India",Universidad del Rosario; Fudan University,"Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India.",julian.cortess@urosario.edu.co,"Cortés, Julián D./B-7716-2016","Cortés, Julián D./0000-0002-1246-2160",,,,,122,7,7,2,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17.0,5.0,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0269116,0.0,,,34,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3L8YU,35617365.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000835048800039,0,Multidisciplinary Sciences

It presents new avenues for comprehending tissue organization. In this context, the ability to assign detected RNA transcripts to individual cells is crucial for downstream analyses, such as in-situ cell type calling. Yet, accurate cell segmentation can be challenging in tissue data, in particular in the absence of a high-quality membrane marker. To address this issue, we introduce ComSeg, a segmentation algorithm that operates directly on single RNA positions and that does not come with implicit or explicit priors on cell shape. ComSeg is applicable in complex tissues with arbitrary cell shapes. Through comprehensive evaluations on simulated and experimental datasets, we show that ComSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for in-situ single-cell RNA profiling and in-situ cell type calling. ComSeg is available as a documented and open source pip package at https://github.com/fish-quant/ComSeg. ComSeg is a cell segmentation algorithm for image-based spatial transcriptomics.

During homeostasis, cells from both periportal zone 1 and pericentral zone 3 contracted in number, whereas cells from midlobular zone 2 expanded in number. Cells within zone 2, which are sheltered from common injuries, also contributed to regeneration after pericentral and periportal injuries. Repopulation from zone 2 was driven by the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2-mechanistic target of rapamycin-cyclin D1 (IGFBP2-mTOR-CCND1) axis.

Inhibiting hyperactive kinases is a viable therapeutic strategy to treat different cancer types. Unfortunately for cancer therapy, kinase signalling networks are robust to external perturbations, thus allowing tumour cells to orchestrate mechanisms that compensate for inhibition of specific kinases. Therefore, there is a need to better understand kinase network structure to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we reconstructed kinase networks from phosphoproteomics data, and compared the activity of its kinase interactions in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. We then tested community detection algorithms to identify kinase components associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, a paradigmatic oncogenic signalling cascade. We found that TTK was usually grouped with networks derived for PI3K, AKT and mTOR kinases. Wet-lab experiments confirmed that TTK is likely to act downstream of AKT and mTOR. We thus showed that our methods can be used to identify potential new members of canonical kinase signalling cascades. Phosphoproteomics allows one to measure the activity of kinases that drive the fluxes of signal transduction pathways involved in biological processes such as immune function, senescence and cell growth. However, deriving knowledge of signalling network circuitry from these data is challenging due to a scarcity of phosphorylation sites that define kinase-kinase relationships. To address this issue, we previously identified around 6,000 phosphorylation sites as markers of kinase-kinase relationships (that may be conceptualised as network edges), from which empirical cell-model-specific weighted kinase networks may be reconstructed. Here, we assess whether the application of community detection algorithms to such networks can identify new components linked to canonical signalling pathways. Phosphoproteomics data from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells treated separately with PI3K, AKT, MEK and ERK inhibitors were used to reconstruct individual kinase networks. We used modularity maximisation to detect communities in each network, and selected the community containing the main target of the inhibitor used to treat cells. These analyses returned communities that contained known canonical signalling components. Interestingly, in addition to canonical PI3K/AKT/mTOR members, the community assignments returned TTK (also known as MPS1) as a likely component of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. We drew similar insights from an external phosphoproteomics dataset from breast cancer cells treated with rapamycin and oestrogen. We confirmed this observation with wet-lab laboratory experiments showing that TTK phosphorylation was decreased in AML cells treated with AKT and MTOR inhibitors. This study illustrates the application of community detection algorithms to the analysis of empirical kinase networks to uncover new members linked to canonical signalling pathways.","[Basanta, Celia De Los Angeles Colomina; Hijazi, Maruan; Cutillas, Pedro R.] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Cell Signaling & Proteom Grp, London, England; [Bazzi, Marya] Univ Warwick, Warwick Math Inst, Coventry, England; [Bazzi, Marya; Bessant, Conrad; Cutillas, Pedro R.] Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Bessant, Conrad] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Warwick; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Cutillas, PR (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Cell Signaling & Proteom Grp, London, England.;Bazzi, M (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Math Inst, Coventry, England.;Bazzi, M; Cutillas, PR (corresponding author), Alan Turing Inst, London, England.",Marya.Bazzi@warwick.ac.uk; p.cutillas@qmul.ac.uk,"Hijazi Vega, Maruan/AAH-7934-2019","Hijazi Vega, Maruan/0000-0003-0861-7577; Rodriguez Cutillas, Pedro/0000-0002-3426-2274; Colomina Basanta, Celia/0000-0001-7896-246X",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Alan Turing Institute [EP/T001569/1]; Blood Cancer UK [20008]; Cancer Research UK [C15966/A24375]; Medical Research Council [MR/R015686/1]; Barts and The London Charity [G-022151],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Alan Turing Institute(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Blood Cancer UK; Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Barts and The London Charity,"This work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, Grant EP/T001569/1) through the Alan Turing Institute (to PRC and MB) and Blood Cancer UK (20008).

The definition of the properties of single cells is the primary endpoint of such analysis, cells are typically clustered to underpin the common determinants that can be used to describe functional properties of the cell mixture under investigation. Several approaches have been proposed to identify cell clusters; while this is matter of active research, one popular approach is based on community detection in neighbourhood graphs by optimisation of modularity. In this paper we propose an alternative and principled solution to this problem, based on Stochastic Block Models. We show that such approach not only is suitable for identification of cell groups, it also provides a solid framework to perform other relevant tasks in single cell analysis, such as label transfer. To encourage the use of Stochastic Block Models, we developed a python library, schist, that is compatible with the popular scanpy framework.","[Morelli, Leonardo; Giansanti, Valentina; Cittaro, Davide] IRCCS San Raffaele Inst, Ctr Omics Sci, Milan, Italy; [Morelli, Leonardo] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; [Giansanti, Valentina] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Informat Syst & Commun, Milan, Italy",Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Cittaro, D (corresponding author), IRCCS San Raffaele Inst, Ctr Omics Sci, Milan, Italy.",cittaro.davide@hsr.it,"Cittaro, Davide/K-2405-2018; Giansanti, Valentina/AAC-3638-2022","Cittaro, Davide/0000-0003-0384-3700; Giansanti, Valentina/0000-0003-0617-6245; Morelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-2477-5172",Cancer Research UK [A26815]; Fondazione AIRC,Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Fondazione AIRC(Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro),This work has been supported by Accelerator Award: A26815 entitled: Single-cell cancer evolution in the clinicfunded through a partnership between Cancer Research UK and Fondazione AIRC.,,61,6,6,1,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,NOV 30,2021,22.0,1,,,,,,,576,10.1186/s12859-021-04489-7,0.0,,,19,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,XF4CI,34847879.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000724019800002,0,Mathematical & Computational Biology

Clustering, which can be used for classification, presents opportunities for identifying hard-to-reach groups for the development of customized health interventions. Due to a desire to convert abundant DNA gene co-expression data into networks, many graph inference methods have been developed. Likewise there are many clustering and classification tools. This paper presents a comparison of techniques for graph inference and clustering, using different numbers of features, in order to select the best tuple of graph inference method, clustering method, and number of features according to a particular phenotype. An extensive machine learning based analysis of the REGARDS dataset is conducted, evaluating the CoNet and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) network inference methods, along with the Louvain, Leiden and NBR-Clust clustering techniques. Results from analysis involving five internal cluster evaluation indices show the traditional KNN inference method and NBR-Clust and Louvain clustering produce the most promising clusters with medical phenotype data. It is also shown that visualization can aid in interpreting the clusters, and that the clusters produced can identify meaningful groups indicating customized interventions.","[Kramer, Jordan; Boone, Lyric; Clifford, Thomas; Bruce, Justin; Matta, John] Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Matta, J (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",jkramer@siue.edu; lyboone@siue.edu; tcliffo@siue.edu; jubruce@siue.edu; jmatta@siue.edu,,"Boone, Lyric/0000-0001-5161-0587; Matta, John/0000-0002-7666-1409",,,,,48,7,10,1,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2194,2168-2208,,IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH,IEEE J.

Existing models primarily focus on estimating O -D demand for various travel purposes throughout the day, which is characterised by its pulsating nature. However, these models often compromise the precision of peak -hour forecasts, leading to unreliable dynamic traffic control and challenges in effectively reducing peak -hour congestion. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method for predicting commuting O -D demand matrices. Our method employs community detection algorithms on road networks to precisely partition commute O -D regions, incorporating Points of Interest (POIs). We also present a spatio-temporal dynamic weighted hypergraph model that leverages these partitioned regions, time characteristics from observed O -D trips, and meteorological data to improve forecasting. Comparative analyses with contemporary models and ablation studies indicate our method significantly enhances prediction accuracy, by approximately 5%. These findings imply that the proposed method more effectively encompasses the varied characteristics of commuting during peak hours, thereby providing more accurate demand matrices for urban traffic management.","[Li, Yuhuan; Cheng, Shaowu; Zhang, Yaping] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Transportat & Sci Engn, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuhuan; Feng, Yuxiang; Angeloudis, Panagiotis; Quddus, Mohammed; Ochieng, Washington Yotto] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Engn & Modelling, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Harbin Institute of Technology; Imperial College London,"Zhang, YP (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Transportat & Sci Engn, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China.;Feng, YX (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Engn & Modelling, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",yuhuan.li22@imperial.ac.uk; csw_h@hit.edu.cn; y.feng19@imperial.ac.uk; zxlt0905@163.com; p.angeloudis@imperial.ac.uk; m.quddus@imperial.ac.uk; w.ochieng@imperial.ac.uk,,"Feng, Yuxiang (Felix)/0000-0002-5530-2503",Sichuan Province Science and Technol-ogy Achievement Transfer Project [24ZHSF0115],Sichuan Province Science and Technol-ogy Achievement Transfer Project,Acknowledgements This work was supported by Sichuan Province Science and Technol-ogy Achievement Transfer Project 24ZHSF0115.,,60,1,1,15,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

This phenomenon significantly hinders information dissemination across communities and fuels societal polarization. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for quantifying echo chambers. In this paper, we present the Echo Chamber Score (ECS), a novel metric that assesses the cohesion and separation of user communities by measuring distances between users in the embedding space. In contrast to existing approaches, ECS is able to function without labels for user ideologies and makes no assumptions about the structure of the interaction graph. To facilitate measuring distances between users, we propose EchoGAE, a self-supervised graph autoencoder-based user embedding model that leverages users' posts and the interaction graph to embed them in a manner that reflects their ideological similarity. To assess the effectiveness of ECS, we use a Twitter dataset consisting of four topics - two polarizing and two non-polarizing. Our results showcase ECS's effectiveness as a tool for quantifying echo chambers and shedding light on the dynamics of online discourse.","[Alatawi, Faisal; Sheth, Paras; Liu, Huan] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Alatawi, F (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",faalataw@asu.edu; psheth5@asu.edu; huanliu@asu.edu,,"Sheth, Paras/0000-0002-6186-6946",Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-21-1-4002],Office of Naval Research (ONR)(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research),This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) under contract/grant number N00014-21-1-4002.,,38,0,0,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2473-9928,2473-991X,979-8-4007-0409-3,PR I-A I C AD S N A,,,2023,,,,,,,38.0,45.0,,10.1145/3625007.3627731,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Communication,BW7KE,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001191293500006,0,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence"

To fill the gap between time series data analysis and complex network theory, the main objective is to capture spatio-temporal patterns of TBM dynamic excavation behavior from a topological structure perspective, which can provide valuable insights into geological information and over excavation ratio for intelligent tunneling project management. To accomplish this goal, the principal component analysis (PCA) is firstly utilized to reduce the dimension of the multivariate and heterogenous dataset for simplicity. Afterward, the time-lagged cross correlation (TLCC) and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) are implemented to measure the similarity between two segment rings for network graphing, resulting in a holistic view of the TBM excavation performance. Through the case study, network analysis results indicate that: (1) Leiden outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms in dividing the whole network into four high-quality communities. (2) There is a trend for segment rings with more similar excavation behavior and geological conditions to be gathered into the same community. (3) Since the over excavation ratio in four communities derived from the DTW-based complex network is proven to be significantly different, global sensitivity analysis is deployed to find out the most crucial features for decisionmaking in TBM control. The novelty to be highlighted is the developed time series analysis approach relying on the complex network perspective, which is helpful in effectively detecting relationships along with hidden engineering knowledge among rings. This has potential value in better understanding and improving the TBM tunneling performance under the underground environment with great complexity and uncertainty.","[Pan, Yue; Zhou, Xiaojing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infras, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Shuigen] Shanghai Mechanized Construct Grp, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; zlm@hust.edu.cn,"Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201171, 72271101]; Shanghai Sailing Program, China [22YF1419100]; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province [2022CFA062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program, China; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72201171 and 72271101) , the Shanghai Sailing Program, China (No: 22YF1419100) , and the Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province (No. 2022CFA062) .",,69,5,5,15,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

Unfortunately, detecting the optimal partition of a network is a computationally demanding task, usually conducted by means of optimization methods. Among them, randomized search heuristics have been proven to be efficient approaches. This manuscript is devoted to providing an overview of community detection problems from the perspective of bio-inspired computation. To this end, we first review the recent history of this research area, placing emphasis on milestone studies contributed in the last five years. Next, we present an extensive experimental study to assess the performance of a selection of modern heuristics over weighted directed network instances. Specifically, we combine seven global search heuristics based on two different similarity metrics and eight heterogeneous search operators designed ad-hoc. We compare our methods with six different community detection techniques over a benchmark of 17 Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi network instances. Ranking statistics of the tested algorithms reveal that the proposed methods perform competitively, but the high variability of the rankings leads to the main conclusion: no clear winner can be declared. This finding aligns with community detection tools available in the literature that hinge on a sequential application of different algorithms in search for the best performing counterpart. We end our research by sharing our envisioned status of this area, for which we identify challenges and opportunities which should stimulate research efforts in years to come. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although deep learning models-especially variational autoencoders-have been widely used to capture low-dimensional feature embeddings, the prevalent Gaussian assumption somewhat disagrees with real data, and these models tend to struggle to incorporate reference information from abundant cell atlases. Here we propose CASTLE, a deep generative model based on the vector-quantized variational autoencoder framework to extract discrete latent embeddings that interpretably characterize single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data. We validate the performance and robustness of CASTLE for accurate cell-type identification and reasonable visualization compared with state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the advantages of CASTLE for effective incorporation of existing massive reference datasets in a weakly supervised or supervised manner. We further demonstrate CASTLE's capacity for intuitively distilling cell-type-specific feature spectra that unveil cell heterogeneity and biological implications quantitatively. A method based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder, called CASTLE, can interpretably extract discrete latent embeddings and quantitatively generate the cell-type-specific feature spectrum for single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data.","[Cui, Xuejian; Chen, Xiaoyang; Li, Zhen; Gao, Zijing; Jiang, Rui] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Minist Educ,Dept Automat,Key Lab Bioinformat,Bioin, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shengquan] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shengquan] Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Jiang, R (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Minist Educ,Dept Automat,Key Lab Bioinformat,Bioin, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",chenshengquan@nankai.edu.cn; ruijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"chen, sq/JFA-5688-2023; cui, xuejian/IQT-7707-2023","chen, sq/0000-0002-3503-9306; Li, Zhen/0000-0002-3013-3416; Chen, Xiaoyang/0000-0002-7356-8129; Cui, Xuejian/0009-0007-8145-212X","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China grant nos. 2021YFF1200902, 2023YFF1204802, the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants no. 62273194.

Single-cell sequencing technology provides substantial prospects to gain an in-depth understanding of the cellular phenotypic variability driving tumor progression. A comprehensive insight into the intra-tumor heterogeneity may further assist in dealing with the treatment-resistant clones in cancer patients, thereby improving their overall survival. However, this task is hampered due to the challenges associated with the single-cell data, such as false positives, false negatives and missing bases, and the increase in their size. As a result, the computational cost of the existing methods increases, thereby limiting their usage. In this work, we propose a robust graph learning-based method, ARCANE-ROG (Algorithm for Reconstruction of CANcer Evolution via RObust Graph learning), for inferring clonal evolution from single-cell datasets. The first step of the proposed method is a joint framework of denoising with data imputation for the noisy and incomplete matrix while simultaneously learning an adjacency graph. Both the operations in the joint framework boost each other such that the overall performance of the denoising algorithm is improved. In the second step, an optimal number of clusters are identified via the Leiden method. In the last step, clonal evolution trees are inferred via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The method has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, RobustClone, using simulated datasets of varying sizes and five real datasets. The performance of our proposed method is found to be significantly superior (p-value < 0.05) in terms of reconstruction error, False Positive to False Negative (FPFN) ratio, tree distance error and V-measure compared to the other method. Overall, the proposed method is an improvement over the existing methods as it enhances cluster assignment and inference on clonal hierarchies.","[Farswan, Akanksha; Gupta, Anubha] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Dept ECE, SBILab, New Delhi, India; [Gupta, Ritu] AIIMS, Dr BRA IRCH, Lab Oncol Unit, New Delhi, India",Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; DR.

However, most graph clustering algorithms just consider low-order topological connectivity, which limits their accuracy in gene module identification. In this study, we propose a novel network-based method, MultiSimNeNc, to identify modules in various types of networks by integrating network representation learning (NRL) and clustering algorithms. In this method, we first obtain the multi-order similarity of the network using graph convolution (GC). Then, we aggregate the multi-order similarity to characterize the network structure and use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to achieve low-dimensional node characterization. Finally, we predict the number of modules based on the bayesian information criterion (BIC) and use the gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify modules. To testify to the efficacy of MultiSimeNc in module identification, we apply this method to two types of biological networks and six benchmark networks, where the biological networks are constructed based on the fusion of multi-omics data from glioblastoma (GBM). The analysis shows that MultiSimNeNc outperforms several state-of-the-art module identification algorithms in identification accuracy, which is an effective method for understanding biomolecular mechanisms of pathogenesis from a module-level perspective.","[Wu, Hao; Liang, Biting; Zhang, Hongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhongli] Peoples Govt Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Shandong University,"Wu, H; Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",haowu@sdu.edu.cn; zhm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Wu, Hao/AGE-4639-2022; Zhang, Hongming/ABF-8690-2021","Wu, Hao/0000-0003-2340-9258; Zhang, Hongming/0000-0001-6133-693X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972322, 62272278]; Natural Key Research and Development Program, China [2021YFF0704103]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Key Research and Development Program, China; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","Funding The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61972322 & 62272278) , and by the Natural Key Research and Development Program, China (Grant No. 2021YFF0704103) , and by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China.

In recent years, the discovery and characterization of protein complexes have substantially progressed through advances in cryo-electron microscopy, proteomics, and computational structure prediction. This development results in a strong need for computational approaches to analyse the data of large protein complexes for structural and functional characterization. Here, we aim to provide a suitable approach, which processes the growing number of large protein complexes, to obtain biologically meaningful information on the hierarchical organization of the structures of protein complexes.Results We modelled the quaternary structure of protein complexes as undirected, labelled graphs called complex graphs. In complex graphs, the vertices represent protein chains and the edges spatial chain-chain contacts. We hypothesized that clusters based on the complex graph correspond to functional biological modules. To compute the clusters, we applied the Leiden clustering algorithm. To evaluate our approach, we chose the human respiratory complex I, which has been extensively investigated and exhibits a known biological module structure experimentally validated. Additionally, we characterized a eukaryotic group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the head of the bacteriophage phi 29. The analysis of the protein complexes correlated with experimental findings and indicated known functional, biological modules. Using our approach enables not only to predict functional biological modules in large protein complexes with characteristic features but also to investigate the flexibility of specific regions and coformational changes. The predicted modules can aid in the planning and analysis of experiments.Availability and implementation Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the examples are available on our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/MolBIFFM/PTGLtools/tree/main/PTGLmodulePrediction.","[Gisdon, Florian J.; Zunker, Mariella; Wolf, Jan Niclas; Pruefer, Kai; Ackermann, Joerg; Koch, Ina] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Comp Sci & Math, Inst Comp Sci, Mol Bioinformat, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Welsch, Christoph] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Univ Hosp, Med Clin 1, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt Hospital,"Gisdon, FJ; Koch, I (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Comp Sci & Math, Inst Comp Sci, Mol Bioinformat, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",florian.gisdon@bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de; ina.koch@bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Gisdon, Florian J./0000-0002-3432-5992","Consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative); ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); Goethe University Frankfurt; Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","Consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative); ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); Goethe University Frankfurt; Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","This work was supported by the consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative) and ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); and Goethe University Frankfurt and the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts (providing financial and infrastructural support).

Because these protein-protein interaction networks, or interactomes, represent pairwise connections within a hierarchically organized system, it is often useful to identify higher-order associations embedded within them, such as multi-member protein complexes. Graph-based clustering techniques are widely used to accomplish this goal, and dozens of field-specific and general clustering algorithms exist. However, interactomes can be prone to errors, especially when inferred from high-throughput biochemical assays. Therefore, robustness to network-level noise is an important criterion. Here, we tested the robustness of a range of graph-based clustering algorithms in the presence of noise, including algorithms common across domains and those specific to protein networks. Strikingly, we found that all of the clustering algorithms tested here markedly amplified network-level noise. Randomly rewiring only 1% of network edges yielded more than a 50% change in clustering results. Moreover, we found the impact of network noise on individual clusters was not uniform: some clusters were consistently robust to injected noise, whereas others were not. Therefore we developed the clust.perturb R package and Shiny web application to measure the reproducibility of clusters by randomly perturbing the network. We show that clust.-perturb results are predictive of real-world cluster stability: poorly reproducible clusters as identified by clust.perturb are significantly less likely to be reclustered across experiments. We conclude that graph-based clustering amplifies noise in protein interaction networks, but quantifying the robustness of a cluster to network noise can separate stable protein complexes from spurious associations.","[Stacey, R.

New datasets are significantly larger than a decade ago, and new experimental techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics continue to drive the need for clustering or classification techniques to focus on portions of datasets of interest. While many libraries and packages exist that implement various algorithms, there remains the need for clustering packages that are easy to use, integrated with visualization of the results, and integrated with other commonly used tools for biological data analysis. clusterMaker2 has added several new algorithms, including two entirely new categories of analyses: node ranking and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, many of the new algorithms have been implemented using the Cytoscape jobs API, which provides a mechanism for executing remote jobs from within Cytoscape. Together, these advances facilitate meaningful analyses of modern biological datasets despite their ever-increasing size and complexity.ResultsThe use of clusterMaker2 is exemplified by reanalyzing the yeast heat shock expression experiment that was included in our original paper; however, here we explored this dataset in significantly more detail. Combining this dataset with the yeast protein-protein interaction network from STRING, we were able to perform a variety of analyses and visualizations from within clusterMaker2, including Leiden clustering to break the entire network into smaller clusters, hierarchical clustering to look at the overall expression dataset, dimensionality reduction using UMAP to find correlations between our hierarchical visualization and the UMAP plot, fuzzy clustering, and cluster ranking. Using these techniques, we were able to explore the highest-ranking cluster and determine that it represents a strong contender for proteins working together in response to heat shock. We found a series of clusters that, when re-explored as fuzzy clusters, provide a better presentation of mitochondrial processes.ConclusionsclusterMaker2 represents a significant advance over the previously published version, and most importantly, provides an easy-to-use tool to perform clustering and to visualize clusters within the Cytoscape network context. The new algorithms should be welcome to the large population of Cytoscape users, particularly the new dimensionality reduction and fuzzy clustering techniques.","[Utriainen, Maija] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Morris, John H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Maastricht University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Morris, JH (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",scooter@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,,,,,75,5,5,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,APR 5,2023,24.0,1,,,,,,,134,10.1186/s12859-023-05225-z,0.0,,,28,Biochemical Research Methods,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,C7ZM4,37020209.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000964054900002,0,Biochemical Research Methods

One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm.

While current approaches are successful in reducing the number of sequence alignments performed, the generated clusters are based on a single sequence identity threshold applied to every cluster. Poor choices of this identity threshold would thus lead to low quality clusters. There is however little support provided to users in selecting thresholds that are well matched with the input sequences. Results We present a novel sequence clustering approach called ALFATClust that exploits rapid pairwise alignment-free sequence distance calculations and community detection in graph for clusters generation. Instead of a single threshold applied to every generated cluster, ALFATClust is capable of dynamically determining the cut-off threshold for each individual cluster by considering both cluster separation and intra-cluster sequence similarity. Benchmarking analysis shows that ALFATClust generally outperforms existing approaches by simultaneously maintaining cluster robustness and substantial cluster separation for the benchmark datasets. The software also provides an evaluation report for verifying the quality of the non-singleton clusters obtained. Conclusions ALFATClust is able to generate sequence clusters having high intra-cluster sequence similarity and substantial separation between clusters without having users to decide precise similarity cut-off thresholds.","[Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore; [Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore.;Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",ephoth@nus.edu.sg,,,"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore [SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04]","Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","This research is supported by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore under its Infectious Disease Programme Research (SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04).",,43,5,6,0,19,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,MAR 30,2022,23.0,1,,,,,,,108,10.1186/s12859-022-04643-9,0.0,,,20,Biochemical Research Methods,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,0D5HH,35354426.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000776025700002,0,Biochemical Research Methods

Current hierarchical community-discovery algorithms generally consider a single node as a community during the initial stage. This approach leads to over-fine clustering granularity, too-deep clustering levels, and other issues. Therefore, this article proposes a hierarchical community-discovery algorithm that combines the core nodes and the three-order structure model. Between neighboring nodes, there is a first-order structure. The core node is identified based on its influence, and the similarity between the core node and its neighboring nodes is defined as the second-order structure. The nodes satisfying the second-order structure are then formed into a friend circle. The similarity between friend circles is defined as the third-order structure. According to this structure, the friend circles are construed as a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) where one HCT represents a community. The HCT built by this algorithm has relatively fewer levels and exhibits a flat feature. Experimental results on both artificial and real networks show that the algorithm performs well on various indicators. Additionally, the algorithm exhibits near-linear time complexity.","[Guo Lei; Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Li Shaozi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Educ Dept Fujian Prov, Key Lab Cognit Comp & Intelligent Informat Proc F, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Guo Lei; Wu Qingshou] Digital Fujian Tourism Big Data Inst, Fujian Dev & Reform Commiss, Wuyishan, Fujian, Peoples R China","Wuyi University, Fujian; Xiamen University","Wu, QS (corresponding author), Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China.",wyswuqsh@163.com,"Li, SZ/G-3959-2010","guo, lei/0000-0001-7269-971X","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University [2019LSAF03]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2019J01835]; Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions [KLCCIIP2018107]","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions","TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University, Grant/Award Number: 2019LSAF03; The Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019J01835; TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions, Grant/Award Number: KLCCIIP2018107",,57,0,0,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

Ownership was aggregated to the NUTS 3 regional level, to which average corporate profitability indicators, the GDP per capita characterizing the economic environment, and the number of patents, which is a proxy of the technological environment, were assigned to NUTS 3 regions. The formation of the ownership network between 2010 and 2018 was characterized using this dataset.

The quantitative method to detect delayed recognition is described as the pair of Sleeping Beauty (SB) and its Prince (PR), where SB refers to citation bursts and its PR triggers SB's awakeness calculated based on their citation history. This research provides the methods to extract valid and large SB-PR pairs from a comprehensive Scopus dataset and analyses how PR discovers SB. We prove that the proposed method can extract long-sleep and large-scale SB and its PR best covers the previous multi-disciplinary pairs, which enables to observe delayed recognition. Besides, we show that the high-impact SB-PR pairs extracted by the proposed method are more likely to be located in the same field. This indicates that a hidden SB that your research can awaken may exist closer than you think. On the other hand, although SB-PR pairs are fat-tailed in Beauty Coefficient and more likely to integrate separate fields compared to ordinary citations, it is not possible to predict which citation leads to awake SB using the rarity of citation. There is no easy way to limit the areas where SB-PR pairs occur or detect it early, suggesting that researchers and administrators need to focus on a variety of areas.

With the increasing awareness of data security and privacy protection, the need to understand the impact of such attacks on traditional community detection algorithms emerges. To this end, we investigate the community obfuscation problem which aims to hide a target set of communities from being detected by perturbing the network structure. We identify and analyze the Matthew effect incurred by the classical quality function based methods, which essentially results in the imbalanced allocation of perturbation resources. To mitigate such effect, we propose a probabilistic framework named as ProHiCo to hide communities. The key idea of ProHiCo is to first allocate the resource of perturbations randomly and fairly and then choose the appropriate edges to perturb via likelihood minimization. Our ProHiCo framework provides the additional freedom to choose the generative graph model with community structure. By incorporating the stochastic block model and its degree-corrected variant into the ProHiCo framework, we develop two scalable and effective algorithms called SBM and DCSBM. Via extensive experiments on 8 real-world networks and 5 community detection algorithms, we show that both SBM and DCSBM are about 30x faster than the prominent baselines in the literature when there are around 500 target communities, while their performance is comparable to the baselines.","[Liu, Xuecheng; Fu, Luoyi; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hopcroft, John E.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Cornell University,"Liu, XC (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",liuxuecheng@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; jeh@cs.cornell.edu,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100302]; NSF China [62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012]",National Key R&D Program of China; NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China 2018YFB2100302, and NSF China under Grant (No. 62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012).",,32,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-166X,,978-0-7381-1281-7,IEEE INFOCOM SER,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488870,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BS2JU,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000702210400204,0,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods"

Transport impedance among ports through transit times and port infrastructures can, however, impact accessibility, trade performance, and the attractiveness of ports. Assessments of the transit routes between ports based on performance and attractiveness criteria can provide a topological liner shipping network that quantifies the performance profile of ports. Here, we constructed a directed global liner shipping network (GLSN) of the top six liner shipping companies between the ports of Africa, Asia, North/South America, Europe, and Oceania. Network linkages and community groupings were quantified through a container port accessibility evaluation model, which quantified the performance of the port using betweenness centrality, the transport impedance among ports with the transit time, and the performance of ports using the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index. The in-degree and out-degree of the GLSN conformed to the power-law distribution, respectively, and their R-square fitting accuracy was greater than 0.96. The community partition illustrated an obvious consistence with the actual trading flow. The accessibility evaluation result showed that the ports in Asia and Europe had a higher accessibility than those of other regions. Most of the top 30 ports with the highest accessibility are Asian (17) and European (10) ports. Singapore, Port Klang, and Rotterdam have the highest accessibility.

This paper fills this research gap via a computational data-driven analysis of a public database of defacers and defacement attacks and activities of 96 selected defacers who were active on Twitter. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data: an analysis of a friendship graph with 10,360 nodes, an analysis on how sentiments of defacers related to attack patterns, and a topical modelling based analysis to study what defacers discussed publicly on Twitter. Our analysis revealed a number of key findings: a modular and hierarchical clustering method can help discover interesting sub-communities of defacers; sentiment analysis can help categorize behaviors of defacers in terms of attack patterns; and topic modelling revealed some focus topics (politics, country-specific topics, and technical discussions) among defacers on Twitter and also geographic links of defacers sharing similar topics. We believe that these findings are useful for a better understanding of defacers' behaviors, which could help design and development of better solutions for detecting defacers and even preventing impeding defacement attacks.","[Aslan, Cagri Burak; Celebi, Fatih V.] STM Def Technol Engn & Trade Inc, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey; [Aslan, Cagri Burak] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Comp Engn Dept, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey; [Li, Shujun] Univ Kent, Sch Comp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Li, Shujun] Univ Kent, Kent Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Cyber Secur KirCCS, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Tian, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",STM; Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University; University of Kent; University of Kent; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Aslan, ÇB (corresponding author), STM Def Technol Engn & Trade Inc, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey.;Aslan, ÇB (corresponding author), Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Comp Engn Dept, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey.;Li, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Comp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.;Li, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Kent Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Cyber Secur KirCCS, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",cagriaslan@gmail.com; hooklee@gmail.com,"ASLAN, Çağrı Burak/AAA-2493-2021; Li, Shujun/A-9032-2008; Aslan, Cagri/JZT-4582-2024","ASLAN, Çağrı Burak/0000-0003-0507-3922; Li, Shujun/0000-0001-5628-7328; Aslan, Cagri/0000-0003-0507-3922","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme [2211-C]; Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K. [EP/R033749/1]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802704]; EPSRC [EP/R033749/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K.(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported in part by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme under Grant 2211-C, in part by the Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K., under Grant EP/R033749/1, and in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802704.",,37,5,5,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8.0,,,,,,204132.0,204143.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037015,0.0,,,12,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OS8VK,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000590436200001,0,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic"

Conventional graph clustering is typically governed by a function defined over all possible cluster configurations but at a fixed value of the resolution hyperparameter denoted as gamma. Such clustering suffers from issues related to the so-called resolution limit or requires resolution tuning. This has been changed by recent theories and algorithms for graph clustering with resolution variation. The requirement for specifying or tuning the gamma-hyperparameter is effectively removed, and the clustering function becomes or transforms to a functional form with gamma as an internal resolution variable. We address a standing and significant challenge in parallel clustering with resolution variation. We identify and remove the key bottlenecks in search operations confined to a specific gamma value, and reduce and minimize redundant search operations at different gamma values. We show impressive performance achieved with our parallel approach on real-world datasets.","[Pitsianis, Nikos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Pitsianis, Nikos; Floros, Dimitris; Liu, Tiancheng; Sun, Xiaobai] Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Liu, Tiancheng] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Pitsianis, N (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.;Pitsianis, N (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2377-6943,,979-8-3503-0860-0,IEEE HIGH PERF EXTR,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/HPEC58863.2023.10363552,0.0,,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BW4YB,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001156959800058,0,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic"

We demonstrate, with our experimental results on 500 benchmark images, that SLAM outperforms the stateof-art algorithms in superpixel quality, by multiple measures, within the same time frame.

Here, we elaborate development of spatial transcriptomic technologies to help researchers select the best-suited technology for their goals and integrate the vast amounts of data to facilitate data accessibility and availability. Then, we marshal various computational approaches to analyze spatial transcriptomic data for various purposes and describe the spatial multimodal omics and its potential for application in tumor tissue.

Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets. Results: We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable time frames. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST.","[Abdelaal, Tamim; Lelieveldt, Boudewijn P.

A number of methods have been developed with the purpose to identify rare cell types. However, existing methods are still not scalable to large datasets, limiting their utility. To overcome this limitation, we present a new software package, called GiniClust3, which is an extension of GiniClust2 and significantly faster and memory-efficient than previous versions. Results Using GiniClust3, it only takes about 7 h to identify both common and rare cell clusters from a dataset that contains more than one million cells. Cell type mapping and perturbation analyses show that GiniClust3 could robustly identify cell clusters. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that GiniClust3 is a powerful tool to identify both common and rare cell population and can handle large dataset.

In this new field, we define as translational machine learning, joint efforts and strong communication between data scientists and clinicians help to span the gap between ML and its adoption in the clinic. These collaborations also improve interpretability and trust in translational ML methods and ultimately aim to result in generalizable and reproducible models. To help clinicians and bioinformaticians refine their translational ML pipelines, we review the steps from model building to the use of ML in the clinic. We discuss experimental setup, computational analysis, interpretability and reproducibility, and emphasize the challenges involved. We highly advise collaboration and data sharing between consortia and institutes to build multi-centric cohorts that facilitate ML methodologies that generalize across centers. In the end, we hope that this review provides a way to streamline translational ML and helps to tackle the challenges that come with it.","[Couckuyt, Artuur; Seurinck, Ruth; Emmaneel, Annelies; Quintelier, Katrien; Novak, David; Van Gassen, Sofie; Saeys, Yvan] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium; [Couckuyt, Artuur; Seurinck, Ruth; Emmaneel, Annelies; Quintelier, Katrien; Novak, David; Van Gassen, Sofie; Saeys, Yvan] VIB UGent Ctr Inflammat Res, Data Min & Modeling Biomed, Ghent, Belgium; [Quintelier, Katrien] Erasmus MC, Dept Pulm Dis, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Ghent University; Ghent University; Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Saeys, Y (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium.;Saeys, Y (corresponding author), VIB UGent Ctr Inflammat Res, Data Min & Modeling Biomed, Ghent, Belgium.",yvan.saeys@ugent.be,"Saeys, Yvan/C-1311-2009","Saeys, Yvan/0000-0002-0415-1506; Novak, David/0000-0003-4574-9093; Couckuyt, Artuur/0000-0001-7858-6521; Quintelier, Katrien/0000-0001-5306-5615; Van Gassen, Sofie/0000-0002-7119-5330; Emmaneel, Annelies/0000-0003-4569-2330",Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen; FWO-TBM program [FWOTBM20190001]; Grand Challenges Program of VIB; Flemish Government [VR 2016 2312 Doc.1521/4]; FWO postdoctoral research grant (Research Foundation-Flanders),Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen; FWO-TBM program; Grand Challenges Program of VIB; Flemish Government; FWO postdoctoral research grant (Research Foundation-Flanders)(FWO),The research leading to these results has received funding from the Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen and from the FWO-TBM program (FWOTBM20190001).

Spatial transcriptomics is a recent technological innovation that measures transcriptomic information while preserving spatial information. Spatial transcriptomic data can be generated in several ways. RNA molecules are measured by in situ sequencing, in situ hybridization, or spatial barcoding to recover original spatial coordinates. The inclusion of spatial information expands the range of possibilities for analysis and visualization, and spurred the development of numerous novel methods.

Many methods such as Monocle 2/3, URD, and STREAM have been developed for tree-based trajectory building. Here, we propose a fast and flexible trajectory learning method, LISA2, for single-cell data analysis. This new method has two distinctive features: (1) LISA2 utilizes specified leaves and root to reduce the complexity for building the developmental trajectory, especially for some special cases such as rare cell populations and adjacent terminal cell states; and (2) LISA2 is applicable for both transcriptomics and epigenomics data. LISA2 visualizes complex trajectories using 3D Landmark ISOmetric feature MAPping (L-ISOMAP). We apply LISA2 to simulation and real datasets in cerebellum, diencephalon, and hematopoietic stem cells including both single-cell transcriptomics data and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin data.

Traditionally, cells have been classified by their morphology or by expression of certain proteins in functionally distinct settings. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies paved the way for the detection and quantitative analysis of cellular content. In this context, transcriptome quantification techniques made their advent, starting from the bulk RNA sequencing, unable to dissect the heterogeneity of a sample, and moving to the first single cell techniques capable of analyzing a small number of cells (1-100), arriving at the current single cell techniques able to generate hundreds of thousands of cells. As experimental protocols have improved rapidly, computational workflows for processing the data have also been refined, opening up to novel methods capable of scaling computational times more favorably with the dataset size and making scRNA-seq much better suited for biomedical research. In this perspective, we will highlight the key technological and computational developments which have enabled the analysis of this growing data, making the scRNA-seq a handy tool in clinical applications.","[Carangelo, Giulia] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Biomed Sci Mario Serio, Florence, Italy; [Magi, Alberto] Univ Florence, Dept Informat Engn, Florence, Italy; [Semeraro, Roberto] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence; University of Florence,"Semeraro, R (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Florence, Italy.",roberto.semeraro@unifi.it,"Magi, Alberto/M-6773-2015; Semeraro, Roberto/AAB-2193-2019","Semeraro, Roberto/0000-0003-0601-6903; Carangelo, Giulia/0000-0001-6531-1756",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [20307],Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC)(Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro),"This work has been supported by the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC Investigator Grant 20307, Third Generation Cancer Genomics).",,143,8,8,3,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.
