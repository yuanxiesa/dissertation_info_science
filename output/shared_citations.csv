While most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network. Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial differences in community detection such as users' tendencies toward preferential attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect of users' location and primary programming language, which was determined using a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts and network scholars interested in studying team formation.","[Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz] James Madison Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Kramer, Brandon L.; Calderon, J.

Drawing from the literature of the sociology of sciences, it defends a community-centered approach of the study of mathematical practice, and assesses the role of the notion of metamathematics in mathematical change and in stabilized mathematical practices. It relies on the case study of the emergence of geometric control theory at the beginning of the 1970s and of the citational practices associated to the community of control theory since the mid 1990s. This case study shows that the introduction of geometric tools in control theory at the end of the 1960s induced a change in the metamathematical views that control theorists had on their objects. I then demonstrate how membership to the community of control theory shapes the production and the reception of the theorems of Stefan, Sussmann and Nagano. Interpreting the historical development and citational practices of this community through the perspective of metamathematics, I conclude by discussing the role of the orbit theorem in control theory, both as a cognitive label and as a social marker of membership to this community.","[Lavau, Sylvain] Inst Euler EIMI, Pesochnaya Nab 10, St Petersbourg 197022, Russia",,"Lavau, S (corresponding author), Inst Euler EIMI, Pesochnaya Nab 10, St Petersbourg 197022, Russia.",lavau@math.univ-lyon1.fr,,,,,,,106,0,0,0,1,SOC ANTHROPOLOGIE CONNAISSANCES,"MARNE LA VALLEE, CEDEX 02","C/O MARC BARBIER, UNIV PARIS MARNE VALEE, CITE DESCARTES CHAMPS MARNE, MARNE LA VALLEE, CEDEX 02, 77 454, FRANCE",1760-5393,,,REV ANTHROPOL CONNAI,Rev.

The problem appears when dealing with graphs that are created over time, such as online social networks where new users appear continuously, or protein interaction networks when new proteins are discovered. For very large graphs, it is computationally too expensive to repeatedly apply standard clustering algorithms. Instead, algorithms whose time complexity only depends on the size of the incoming subset of edges in every step are needed. At the same time, such algorithms should find clusterings whose quality is close to that produced by offline algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the computational model and present an incremental clustering algorithm. We test the algorithm performance and quality on a wide variety of instances. Our results show that the algorithm far outperforms offline algorithms while retaining a large fraction of their clustering quality.","[Langguth, Johannes] Simula Res Lab, Fornebu, Baerum, Norway; [Langguth, Johannes] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Tumanis, Aigars] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Azad, Ariful] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",BI Norwegian Business School; University of Oslo; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Langguth, J (corresponding author), Simula Res Lab, Fornebu, Baerum, Norway.;Langguth, J (corresponding author), BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.",langguth@simula.no; aigtum@gmail.com; azad@iu.edu,,"Azad, Ariful/0000-0003-1332-8630",,,,,27,1,1,1,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-9232,,978-1-6654-2427-1,INT CONF DAT MIN WOR,,,2021,,,,,,,360.0,369.0,,10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00051,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS9CY,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000779306300044,0

In Legal domain, recommender systems (RS) effectively identify and recommend referentially and/or semantically relevant judgments. Due to the availability of enormous amounts of judgments, RS needs to compute pairwise similarity scores for all unique judgment pairs in advance, aiming to minimize the recommendation response time. This practice introduces the scalability issue as the number of pairs to be computed increases quadratically with the number of judgments i.e., O (n(2)). However, there is a limited number of pairs consisting of strong relevance among the judgments. Therefore, it is insignificant to compute similarities for pairs consisting of trivial relevance between judgments. To address the scalability issue, this research proposes a graph clustering based novel Legal Document Recommendation System (LDRS) that forms clusters of referentially similar judgments and within those clusters find semantically relevant judgments. Hence, pairwise similarity scores are computed for each cluster to restrict search space within-cluster only instead of the entire corpus. Thus, the proposed LDRS severely reduces the number of similarity computations that enable large numbers of judgments to be handled. It exploits a highly scalable Louvain approach to cluster judgment citation network, and Doc2Vec to capture the semantic relevance among judgments within a cluster. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed LDRS are evaluated and analyzed using the large real-life judgments of the Supreme Court of India. The experimental results demonstrate the encouraging performance of proposed LDRS in terms of Accuracy, F1-Scores, MCC Scores, and computational complexity, which validates the applicability for scalable recommender systems.","[Dhanani, Jenish; Mehta, Rupa; Rana, Dipti] SV Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Surat, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology,"Dhanani, J (corresponding author), SV Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Surat, India.",jenishdhanani26@gmail.com,"Rana, Dipti P/T-7819-2019; Mehta, Rupa G./AEM-1046-2022","Rana, Dipti P/0000-0002-5058-1355; Mehta, Rupa G./0000-0002-6260-0488",,,,,42,11,12,3,19,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1064-1246,1875-8967,,J INTELL FUZZY SYST,J.

These graphs can be large and complex when taking into account the number of contacts used in tracing. Compression of the graph allows for the development of community detection as well as providing a simpler graph. By examining the contact networks developed by an evolutionary algorithm for compression, it is discovered that the choice of fitness function and the appropriate weighting of edges leads to a different compressed graph, finding different connected communities; this is also true when compared to the communities identified by the Louvain community detection algorithm. This demonstrates the importance of considering weighting in contact networks, and suggests that in the future an understanding of the community structure should be utilized by public health officials.","[Rutkowski, Emilia; Sargant, James; Houghten, Sheridan] Brock Univ, Dept Comp Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Brown, Joseph Alexander] Innopolis Univ, AI Games Dev Lab, Innopolis, Russia",Brock University; Innopolis University,"Rutkowski, E (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Comp Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada.",er13iq@brocku.ca; js17sy@brocku.ca; shoughten@brocku.ca; j.brown@innopolis.ru,"Brown, Joseph Alexander/HTS-9117-2023","Brown, Joseph Alexander/0000-0002-6513-4929",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,34,1,1,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-8392-3,IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT,,,2021,,,,,,,434.0,441,,10.1109/CEC45853.2021.9504833,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Operations Research & Management Science,BS2MS,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000703866100055,0

To address this gap, we propose a novel method for tracking the evolution of communities (TREC). TREC efficiently detects similar communities through a combination of Locality Sensitive Hashing and Minhashing. We provide experimental evidence on four benchmark datasets and real dynamic datasets such as AS, DBLP, Yelp, and Digg and compare them with the baseline work. The results show that TREC achieves an accuracy of about 98%, has a minimal space requirement, and is very close to the best performing work in terms of time complexity.

The first phase of this work consists of the detection of modules followed by their functional characterization. Here, we unveil the functionality of the species by capturing it in functional modules. In the second phase, we move towards a cross-species analysis where we compare the functional modules of the different species to settle the similarities between them.

In these domains, data changes over time, so a non-static analysis is required to obtain feasible solutions. In this type of environments, MOGAs are often time-consuming and require special adaptation to work properly. A number of different techniques have been proposed to adapt MOGAs to dynamic environments for tackling the previous problems such as hypermutation, memory and immigrant schemes or multi-population methods, among others. In particular, immigrant strategies are one of the most commonly used methods, for that reason, this work proposes a new methodology that allows to make a detailed evaluation of their performance when these strategies are used. The proposed methodology works on two levels, a coarse-grain one and a fine-grain one. In the former, an overall evaluation of the different immigrant strategies is made based on three different dimensions: Quality, Stability and Speed. In the latter, a detailed study of the status of the immigrant individuals during the evolution of the algorithm is carried out. This is a very relevant aspect to take into account in order to evaluate whether an immigrant strategy is working properly or not. To deploy this methodology, a new visualization technique for population mixing analysis is proposed in this work. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a test case in the context of the Dynamic Community Detection problem (DCD) has been selected using a MOGA that applies several different immigrant schemes, showing both how the methodology works and how it could be employed in a particular dynamic problem.","[Panizo-Lledot, Angel; Bello-Orgaz, Gema; Camacho, David] Tech Univ Madrid, Comp Syst Engn Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pedemonte, Martin] Univ Republica, Inst Comp, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay","Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Panizo-Lledot, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Comp Syst Engn Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain.",angel.panizo@upm.es,"Pedemonte, Mart√≠n/H-8249-2013; Camacho, David/B-5779-2014; , Gema/C-8170-2014","Pedemonte, Mart√≠n/0000-0002-8348-0921; Camacho, David/0000-0002-5051-3475; , Gema/0000-0003-2826-3286","XAI-DisInfodemics [PLEC2021-007681]; FightDIS [PID2020-117263GB-100]; ERDF (a way of making Europe); European Union; European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19; BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19; European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub [2020-EU-IA-0252]; ANII [MOV_CA_2019_1_156657]; CSIC, UDELAR, at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid through Convenio Plurianual; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]","XAI-DisInfodemics; FightDIS; ERDF (a way of making Europe)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); European Union(European Union (EU)); European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR(European Union (EU)); Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19; BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19; European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub; ANII; CSIC, UDELAR, at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid through Convenio Plurianual; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid;","This work was supported in part by the XAI-DisInfodemics under Grant PLEC2021-007681, in part by the FightDIS under Grant PID2020-117263GB-100, in part by Grant MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, in part by ERDF (a way of making Europe), in part by the European Union, in part by the European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR, in part by the Research Project CIVIC: Intelligent Characterization of the Veracity of the Information Related to COVID-19, in part by BBVA Foundation Grants for Scientific Research Teams SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and in part by the European Commission through the IBERIFIER-Iberian Digital Media Research and Fact-Checking Hub under Grant 2020-EU-IA-0252.

The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices' status, such as battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept, which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be exploited to extract established relationships between devices and enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the devices' features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. This allows a better IoT network learning and understanding and also, speeds up the service lookup search space. Finally, we discuss implementing the GNN-assisted context-service discovery processes in novel smart city IoT-enabled applications.","[Hamrouni, Aymen; Ghazzai, Hakim; Massoud, Yehia] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Innovat Technol Labs ITL, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Khanfor, Abdullah] Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Najran 55461, Saudi Arabia",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Najran University,"Massoud, Y (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Innovat Technol Labs ITL, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia.",yehia.massoud@kaust.edu.sa,"Khanfor, Abdullah/AAB-9295-2020; Hamrouni, Aymen/ABD-4328-2020; Ghazzai, Hakim/K-2518-2019","Khanfor, Abdullah/0000-0001-8592-5309; Hamrouni, Aymen/0000-0002-8490-7878; Ghazzai, Hakim/0000-0002-8636-4264; Massoud, Yehia/0000-0002-6701-0639",,,,,70,3,3,13,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10.0,,,,,,107330.0,107345.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3212370,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,5J0BO,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000868713100001,0

Furthermore, we also suggest a way to assign sub-networks divided by community extraction methods to the source network and the validation network to select pre-labeling nodes, which is a significant challenge for multiple-role discovery in real-world networks.

However, this topic has not been investigated in detail. This study, first, deploys science mapping techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output, impact, and structure of the Colombian scientific elite, i.e., researchers awarded with the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize 1990-2020, known locally as the Colombian Nobel. Second, we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990-2020 via the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al. Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases. The Colombian scientific elite also showed positive growth, which is an inverse trend compared with the sample of Nobel laureate productivity. There were no noticeable changes in productivity/impact before and after receiving the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize. Institutional collaboration within the Colombian scientific elite displayed the highest betweenness (brokerage) role of world/local top-tier universities. However, only two Colombian scientific elite members published an article with two Nobel Prize laureates. Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities, but were found to diverge from the national focus in respect of strategic research capacities. The interleaving of the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates-particularly between the 3(rd) and 2(nd) quartiles-enabled a more nuanced analysis of the local impact in the global scientific landscape. Our findings also contrast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America, despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals, and also shed light on the research performance-impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in-context assessment of outstanding local research.","[Cortes, Julian D.] Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Julian D.] Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cortes, Julian D.] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India",Universidad del Rosario; Fudan University,"Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India.",julian.cortess@urosario.edu.co,"Cort√©s, Juli√°n D./B-7716-2016","Cort√©s, Juli√°n D./0000-0002-1246-2160",,,,,122,7,7,2,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17.0,5.0,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0269116,0.0,,,34,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3L8YU,35617365.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000835048800039,0

We relax this restriction and introduce the Attributed Vertex Replacement Grammar (AVRG), which can be efficiently extracted from heterogeneous (i.e., typed, colored, or attributed) graphs. Unlike current state-of-the-art methods, which train enormous models over complicated deep neural architectures, the AVRG model is unsupervised and interpretable. It is based on context-free string grammars and works by encoding graph rewriting rules into a graph grammar containing graphlets and instructions on how they fit together. We show that the AVRG can encode succinct models of input graphs yet faithfully preserve their structure and assortativity properties. Experiments on large real-world datasets show that graphs generated from the AVRG model exhibit substructures and attribute configurations that match those found in the input networks.","[Sikdar, Satyaki; Weninger, Tim] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Shah, Neil] Snap Inc, Santa Monica, CA USA",University of Notre Dame,"Sikdar, S (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ssikdar@nd.edu; nshah@snap.com; tweninge@nd.edu,"Sikdar, Satyaki/AAL-6143-2020","Sikdar, Satyaki/0000-0003-1669-6594",US National Science Foundation [1652492]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1652492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),This work is supported by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (#1652492).,,59,0,0,3,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9132-0,,,,2022,,,,,,,928.0,936.0,,10.1145/3488560.3498492,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT2LP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000810504300099,0

Bad actors abuse policies and services like claims, coupons, payouts, etc., to gain material benefits. These fraudsters often work collusively (rings), and it is difficult to identify underlying relationships between them when analyzing individual actors. Fraud rings identification can be modeled as a community detection problem on graphs where nodes are the actors, and the edges represent common attributes between them. However, the challenge lies in incorporating the attributes' domain-informed importance and hierarchy in coming up with edge weights. Treating all edge types as equal (and binary) can be fairly naive; we show that using domain knowledge considerably outperforms other methods. For community detection itself, while the weight information is expected to be learned automatically in deep learning-based methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), it is explicitly provided in traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a scalable and extensible end-to-end framework based on domain-aware weighted community detection to detect fraud rings. We first convert a multi-edge weighted graph into a homogeneous weighted graph and perform domain-aware edge-weight optimization to maximize modularity using the Leiden community detection algorithm. We then use features of communities and nodes to classify both community and a node as fraud or not.

However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.","[Nembrini, Riccardo; Carugno, Costantino; Dacrema, Maurizio Ferrari; Cremonesi, Paolo] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Nembrini, Riccardo; Carugno, Costantino] ContentWise, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Nembrini, R (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.;Nembrini, R (corresponding author), ContentWise, Milan, Italy.",riccardo.nembrini@polimi.it; costantino.carugno@polimi.it; maurizio.ferrari@polimi.it; paolo.cremonesi@polimi.it,,"Ferrari Dacrema, Maurizio/0000-0001-7103-2788",,,,,43,4,4,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9278-5,,,,2022,,,,,,,579.0,585.0,,10.1145/3523227.3551478,0.0,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW3KR,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001139226600080,0

The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. Similarly, we may want to simplify graphons in terms of communities, in order to gain a comprehensible description of their meso-scale structure. This raises the question of how communities in graphons can be identified. In this paper, we define a graphon modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximized to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximization as a continuous optimization problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximizing the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.","[Klimm, Florian; Jones, Nick S.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Klimm, Florian] Univ Cambridge, MRC Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Klimm, Florian] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, Dept Computat Mol Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Klimm, Florian] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Schaub, Michael T.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Comp Sci, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",Imperial College London; University of Cambridge; Max Planck Society; Free University of Berlin; RWTH Aachen University,"Klimm, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Klimm, F (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, MRC Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.;Klimm, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, Dept Computat Mol Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.;Klimm, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",klimm@molgen.mpg.de; nick.jones@imperial.ac.uk; schaub@cs.rwth-aachen.de,,,EPSRC (Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare) [EP/N014529/1]; Ministry of Culture and Science (MKW) of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW Ruckkehrprogramm); EPSRC [EP/N014529/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC (Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare); Ministry of Culture and Science (MKW) of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW Ruckkehrprogramm); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The work of the first and second authors was supported by the EPSRC (Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare; EP/N014529/1).

Here the authors report single cell transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes to delineate regulatory programs driving this process and to define the immunodeficiency-associated developmental defects resulting from Foxn1 dysfunction. Maldevelopment of the pharyngeal endoderm, an embryonic tissue critical for patterning of the pharyngeal region and ensuing organogenesis, ultimately contributes to several classes of human developmental syndromes and disorders. Such syndromes are characterized by a spectrum of phenotypes that currently cannot be fully explained by known mutations or genetic variants due to gaps in characterization of critical drivers of normal and dysfunctional development. Despite the disease-relevance of pharyngeal endoderm, we still lack a comprehensive and integrative view of the molecular basis and gene regulatory networks driving pharyngeal endoderm development. To close this gap, we apply transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility single-cell sequencing technologies to generate a multi-omic developmental resource spanning pharyngeal endoderm patterning to the emergence of organ-specific epithelia in the developing mouse embryo. We identify cell-type specific gene regulation, distill GRN models that define developing organ domains, and characterize the role of an immunodeficiency-associated forkhead box transcription factor.","[Magaletta, Margaret E.; Lobo, Macrina; Kernfeld, Eric M.; Huey, Jack D.; Parsons, Teagan J.; Maehr, Rene] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Magaletta, Margaret E.; Lobo, Macrina; Kernfeld, Eric M.; Huey, Jack D.; Parsons, Teagan J.; Maehr, Rene] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Diabet Ctr Excellence, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Aliee, Hananeh; Theis, Fabian J.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Computat Biol, Munich, Germany; [Theis, Fabian J.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Math, Munich, Germany; [Theis, Fabian J.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Maehr, R (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.;Maehr, R (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Diabet Ctr Excellence, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",rene.maehr@umassmed.edu,"Theis, Fabian J/ABD-5212-2021","Theis, Fabian J/0000-0002-2419-1943; Maehr, Rene/0000-0002-9520-3382; Magaletta, Margaret/0000-0003-2858-7432","University of Pennsylvania Orphan Disease Center; Hypopara Research Foundation; Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking Fund through Helmholtz AI [ZT-I-PF-5-01]; Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking Fund through sparse2big [ZT-I-007]; U.S.Israel Binational Science Foundation; [R01AI132963]; [U01DK104218]; [T32 AI132152]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [T32AI132152, R01AI132963] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [U01DK104218] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",University of Pennsylvania Orphan Disease Center; Hypopara Research Foundation; Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking Fund through Helmholtz AI; Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking Fund through sparse2big; U.S.Israel Binational Science Foundation(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); ; ; ; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),"This work was supported by R01AI132963, U01DK104218, a grant from the U.S.Israel Binational Science Foundation, and a research grant from the University of Pennsylvania Orphan Disease Center in partnership with the Hypopara Research Foundation to R.M., by T32 AI132152 pre-doctoral training support to M.E.M., and by Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking Fund through Helmholtz AI [grant number: ZT-I-PF-5-01] and sparse2big [grant number ZT-I-007] to F.J.T.

However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank (https://cellrank.org) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.","[Lange, Marius; Bergen, Volker; Klein, Michal; Ansari, Meshal; Theis, Fabian J.] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Computat Biol, Munich, Germany; [Lange, Marius; Bergen, Volker; Theis, Fabian J.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Math, Munich, Germany; [Setty, Manu; Pe'er, Dana] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Program Computat & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Reuter, Bernhard] Univ Tubingen, Dept Comp Sci, Tubingen, Germany; [Reuter, Bernhard] Zuse Inst Berlin ZIB, Berlin, Germany; [Bakhti, Mostafa; Lickert, Heiko] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Diabet & Regenerat Res, Munich, Germany; [Bakhti, Mostafa; Lickert, Heiko] German Ctr Diabet Res DZD, Neuherberg, Germany; [Ansari, Meshal; Schniering, Janine; Schiller, Herbert B.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Comprehens Pneumol Ctr CPC, Inst Lung Biol & Dis ILBD, Munich, Germany; [Ansari, Meshal; Schniering, Janine; Schiller, Herbert B.] German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Munich, Germany; [Theis, Fabian J.] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Munich, Germany; [Setty, Manu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Basic Sci Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Setty, Manu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Translat Data Sci IRC, Seattle, WA USA",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Zuse Institute Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,"Theis, FJ (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Computat Biol, Munich, Germany.;Theis, FJ (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Math, Munich, Germany.;Pe'er, D (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Program Computat & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA.;Theis, FJ (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Munich, Germany.",peerd@mskcc.org; fabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Gote-Schniering, Janine/IWM-1593-2023; Bakhti, Mostafa/ADR-3394-2022; Reuter, Bernhard/ADI-6793-2022; Theis, Fabian J/ABD-5212-2021","Gote-Schniering, Janine/0000-0001-7869-4936; Theis, Fabian J/0000-0002-2419-1943; Bakhti, Mostafa/0000-0002-2307-1122; Bergen, Volker/0000-0003-2486-1473; Lange, Marius/0000-0002-4846-1266; Pe'er, Dana/0000-0002-9259-8817; Ansari, Meshal/0000-0002-8819-7965; Klein, Michal/0000-0002-2433-6380; Lickert, Heiko/0000-0002-4597-8825; Reuter, Bernhard/0000-0002-1617-6778",Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen -Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH),Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen -Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH),Open access funding provided by Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen -Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH).,,105,213,230,5,53,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1548-7091,1548-7105,,NAT METHODS,Nat.

It merges as a new way to provide a systematic view and complementary information of COVID-19 progression in the US, enabling evidence-based responses towards pandemic intervention and prevention. To begin with, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US. Then, relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics, which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics. Lastly, the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement, community detection, and online random forest, which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic. It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer (DER) are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution. Social factors regarding the political party, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network. Moreover, the cluster-specific predictor based on online random forest and sliding window is proven useful in dynamically capturing and predicting the epidemiological trends for each community, which can reach the highest.","[Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Unwin, Juliette] MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, London, England; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Taichung 413310, Taiwan; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Theoret & Appl Informat, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Nanyang Technological University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chaoyang University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Theoretical & Applied Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg; h.unwin@imperial.ac.uk,"Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024","Unwin, Juliette/0000-0002-9120-4003","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore [04MNP000279C120, 04MNP002126C120]; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [04INS000423C120]","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University)","This study is supported by the Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore (No. 04MNP000279C120, No. 04MNP002126C120) and the Start-Up Grant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (No. 04INS000423C120) .",,58,15,15,1,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

The objective of this work was to leverage information extracted from large databases to evaluate the consistency and validity of these subjective reports, and to determine their correlation with the reported cultivars and with estimates of their chemical composition (delta-9-THC, CBD, terpenes). Methods: We analyzed a large publicly available dataset extracted from Leafly.com where users freely reported their experiences with cannabis cultivars, including different subjective effects and flavour associations. This analysis was complemented with information on the chemical composition of a subset of the cultivars extracted from Psilabs.org. The structure of this dataset was investigated using network analysis applied to the pairwise similarities between reported subjective effects and/or chemical compositions. Random forest classifiers were used to evaluate whether reports of flavours and subjective effects could identify the labelled species cultivar. We applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to free narratives written by the users to validate the subjective effect and flavour tags. Finally, we explored the relationship between terpenoid content, cannabinoid composition and subjective reports in a subset of the cultivars. Results: Machine learning classifiers distinguished between species tags given by Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica based on the reported flavours: = 0.828 +/- 0.002 (p < 0.001); and effects: = 0.9965 +/- 0.0002 (p < 0.001). A significant relationship between terpene and cannabinoid content was suggested by positive correlations between subjective effect and flavour tags (p < 0.05, False-Discovery-rate (FDR)-corrected); these correlations clustered the reported effects into three groups that represented unpleasant, stimulant and soothing effects. The use of predefined tags was validated by applying latent semantic analysis tools to unstructured written reviews, also providing breed-specific topics consistent with their purported subjective effects. Terpene profiles matched the perceptual characterizations made by the users, particularly for the terpene-flavours graph (Q = 0.324). Conclusions: Our work represents the first data-driven synthesis of self-reported and chemical information in a large number of cannabis cultivars. Since terpene content is robustly inherited and less influenced by environmental factors, flavour perception could represent a reliable marker to indirectly characterize the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Our novel methodology helps meet demands for reliable cultivar characterization in the context of an ever-growing market for medicinal and recreational cannabis.","[de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Phys Inst IFIBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Phys, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia] Favaloro Univ, INECO Fdn, Inst Cognit & Translat Neurosci INCYT, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Carrillo, Facundo; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ferran, Andres Sanchez] Natl Univ Tucuman, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Carrillo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Appl Artificial Intelligence Lab, ICC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pallavicini, Carla] FLENI CONICET, Grp Invest Neurociencias Aplicadas & Alteraciones, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Phys Inst IFIBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Phys, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",krlitax@gmail.com,,,CONICET,CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),AF and FZ were supported by a doctoral fellowship from CONICET.

In this paper, we introduce Semi-Local Integration (SLI), a node centrality measure for undirected and weighted graphs that takes into account the coherence of the locally connected subnetwork and evaluates the integration of nodes within their neighbourhood. We illustrate SLI node importance differentiation among nodes in lexical networks and demonstrate its potential in natural language processing (NLP). In the NLP task of sense identification and sense structure analysis, the SLI centrality measure evaluates node integration and provides the necessary local resolution by differentiating the importance of nodes to a greater extent than standard centrality measures. This provides the relevant topological information about different subnetworks based on relatively local information, revealing the more complex sense structure. In addition, we show how the SLI measure can improve the results of sentiment analysis. The SLI measure has the potential to be used in various types of complex networks in different research areas.","[Ban Kirigin, Tajana; Bujacic Babic, Sanda] Univ Rijeka, Dept Math, R Matejcic 2, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Perak, Benedikt] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Sveucilisna Avenija 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Kirigin, TB (corresponding author), Univ Rijeka, Dept Math, R Matejcic 2, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",bank@uniri.hr; sbujacic@uniri.hr; bperak@uniri.hr,"Bujaƒçiƒá Babiƒá, Sanda/ABD-2655-2021; Ban Kirigin, Tajana/S-5587-2018; Perak, Benedikt/T-1442-2018","Ban Kirigin, Tajana/0000-0003-3230-6891; Perak, Benedikt/0000-0003-4177-5307; Bujacic Babic, Sanda/0000-0001-8842-3830",Croatian Science Foundation [UIP-05-2017-9219]; University of Rijeka [UNIRI-human-18-243],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,FundingThis work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project UIP-05-2017-9219 and the University of Rijeka under the project UNIRI-human-18-243.,,40,4,4,1,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,FEB,2022,10,3.0,,,,,,,405,10.3390/math10030405,0.0,,,16,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,ZH2EA,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000760756300001,0

As large-scale scRNA-seq datasets are becoming more available and affordable, there is a growing demand for computational scalable methods to analyze scRNA-seq data. Here, we propose a scalable framework, scPI, to infer the latent low-dimensional representations of the scRNA-seq data to facilitate downstream analysis. Our method scPI makes use of the amortized variational inference, where the posterior mean and variance of the latent variable are parameterized by a nonlinear neural network. This inference structure combined with stochastic optimization enables its computational efficiency and scalability. Through the analysis of two real datasets, we demonstrate that the scPI framework can be effectively applied to several probabilistic models for scRNA-seq data, in terms of its scalability, missing value imputation and cell type clustering.

Label propagation-based algorithms use local criteria and have a near-linear time complexity. However, these algorithms have problems such as low accuracy, instability, and high computational time in comparison with other local methods. This article presents a fast and simple label diffusion method (FSLD), using local criteria to discover communities accurately in large-scale networks. In FSLD method, community formation is initially started from a low-degree periphery node and then it diffuses its label from outer to inner side of community in a multi-level way. In next step, using a label updating step, all nodes from high-degree to low-degree have the potential to update and finalize their label to obtain initial communities. The experimental results reveal the higher accuracy and performance of the proposed FSLD algorithm in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms.","[Bouyer, Asgarali; Azad, Khatereh; Rouhi, Alireza] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran",Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University,"Bouyer, A (corresponding author), Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",a.bouyer@azaruniv.ac.ir,"Rouhi, Alireza/L-2209-2018; Bouyer, Asgarali/IYS-5116-2023; Bouyer, AsgarAli/JOZ-6483-2023","Rouhi, Alireza/0000-0003-1494-3467; Bouyer, Asgarali/0000-0002-4808-2856;",,,,,67,6,6,2,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-1079,1563-5104,,INT J GEN SYST,Int.

For efficient community detection in a social network, the influence node plays a vital role. A node in the social network or a user that has great influence and power would have a close relationship with a core of the group, termed a community. Therefore, the status of a person is determined by the user's influence strength. That is, a user who has greater influence and strength plays a vital role in the social media community and also acts as a core in the community of the social network. Therefore, a community is a group of nodes in the complex network structure which are interlinked with one another. Effective community detection in a complex structure is a challenging task. Many studies have been done based on topological networks. The approaches are ineffective, inefficient and require more time to process.

SLAM leverages a graph representation of the image, which encodes the pixel features and similarities, for its rich potential in implicit feature transformation and extra means for feature differentiation and association at multiple resolution scales. We demonstrate, with our experimental results on 500 benchmark images, that SLAM outperforms the stateof-art algorithms in superpixel quality, by multiple measures, within the same time frame. The contributions are at least twofold: SLAM breaks down the long-standing speed barriers in graph-based algorithms for superpixel segmentation; it lifts the fundamental limitations in the feature-point-based algorithms.","[Floros, Dimitris; Pitsianis, Nikos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Liu, Tiancheng; Pitsianis, Nikos; Sun, Xiaobai] Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Duke University,"Floros, D (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2377-6943,,978-1-6654-9786-2,IEEE HIGH PERF EXTR,,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/HPEC55821.2022.9926359,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BU3CO,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000890048500051,0

In this process, redundant and cunning entries must be identified and eliminated to improve the data quality. To archive this, a comparison between all entities is performed. However, this has quadratic computational complexity. To avoid this, `blocking' is introduced to limit comparisons to probable matches. This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor graph-based blocking approach utilizing state-of-the-art context-aware sentence embeddings from pre-trained transformers. Our approach maps each database tuple to a node and generates a graph where nodes are connected by edges if they are related. We then invoke unsupervised community detection techniques over this graph and treat blocking as a graph clustering problem. Our work is motivated by the scarcity of training data for entity matching in real-world scenarios and the limited scalability of blocking schemes in the presence of proliferating data. We test the capabilities of our blocking system on four data sets exhibiting more than 6 million comparisons. We show that our block processing times vary from 59s to 461s owing to the efficient data structure of the k-nearest neighbor graph. Our results also show that our method achieves better performance in terms of F1 score when compared to current deep learning-based blocking solutions.","[Mugeni, John Bosco; Amagasa, Toshiyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Mugeni, JB (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",bosco@kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp; amagasa@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Amagasa, Toshiyuki/0000-0003-0595-2230; Mugeni, John Bosco/0000-0002-2464-413X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22H03694, 23K24949] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,22,0,0,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-8713-2,,,,2022,,,,,,,357,364,,10.1145/3477314.3507689,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BU8EH,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000946564100048,0

Plenty of methods have been proposed for community detection in recent years. Among them, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been widely explored for community detection due to their strong competence at exploring the global discrete search space. However, existing GA algorithms for community detection still face major challenges when handling large and complex networks due to their use of random mutation operators. Whenever any candidate community structure in a GA population is mutated, a mutated node of the network under processing is often associated to a community with loose connections, seriously hurting GA's effectiveness and scalability. To address this issue, a newly designed Leiden-based GA (LGA) with a novel mutation operator based on the Leiden algorithm is proposed in this paper to improve the effectiveness of the mutation operator and the performance of the GA approach. Experiment results clearly show that LGA can achieve highly competitive performance in comparison to several state-of-the-art GA and non-GA community detection algorithms on multiple synthetic and real-world networks.","[de Silva, Anjali; Chen, Aaron; Ma, Hui; Nekooei, Mohammad] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"de Silva, A (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",desilanja@ecs.vuw.ac.nz; aaron.chen@ecs.vuw.ac.nz; Hui.Ma@ecs.vuw.ac.nz; mohammadnekooei@ecs.vuw.ac.nz,,"de Silva, Anjali/0000-0001-8923-6893; Nekooei, Seyed Mohammad/0000-0001-7965-6931; Ma, Hui/0000-0002-6232-4436",,,,,31,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-031-22694-6; 978-3-031-22695-3,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2022,13728.0,,,,,,252,265,,10.1007/978-3-031-22695-3_18,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BU6OO,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000926776100018,0

Various global and local techniques exist for uncovering community structures in social networks wherein diffusion-based algorithms are proposed as novel methods for local community detection, particularly suited for large-scale networks. The efficacy of diffusion processes and initial detection is paramount in the successful identification of community structures within social networks. This effectiveness hinges significantly on the meticulous selection of the label diffuser core, which serves as the foundation for propagating labels through the network, and the precise labeling of boundary nodes. Addressing the constraints of current community detection algorithms, notably their time complexity and efficiency, this paper proposes a novel local community detection algorithm that combines core expansion with label diffusion, and deep embedding techniques. In the proposed method, a new centrality measure is introduced for appropriate core selection to facilitate precise label diffusion in the initial phase. Subsequently, a deep embedding technique is employed for updating labels of boundary and core nodes using the GraphSage embedding method. Finally, a rapid merging step is executed to amalgamate initially proximate communities into finalized community structures in large-scale social networks. We evaluate our algorithm on 14 real-world and 4 synthetic networks and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of NMI, F-measure, ARI, and modularity. According to numerical results, the proposed method shows approximately 1.04 %, 1.03 %, and 1.12 % improvement in F-measure, NMI, and ARI measures respectively, compared to the second-best method, LBLD, in the networks with ground-truth. In addition, our method is able to accurately identify communities in large-scale networks such as Orkut, YouTube, and LiveJournal, where it ranks among the top-performing methods. Our approach exhibits the best performance in terms of ARI compared to other algorithms under comparison.","[Bouyer, Asgarali; Shahgholi, Pouya] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Comp Engn, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Bouyer, Asgarali; Arasteh, Bahman] Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Arasteh, Bahman] Khazar Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Istinye Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Western Caspian Univ, Dept Mech & Math, Baku, Azerbaijan",Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University; Istinye University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Khazar University; Istinye University; Yuan Ze University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Western Caspian University,"Tirkolaee, EB (corresponding author), Istinye Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkiye.",erfansjs@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0045-7906,1879-0755,,COMPUT ELECTR ENG,Comput.

However, the majority of current models fail to capture the physics of power flows and the heterogeneity of the grids under study. This study addresses this gap by comparing the levels of heterogeneity in continent-sized power grids in Europe and North America to reveal the underlying universality and heterogeneity of grid frequencies, electrical parameters, and topological structures. Empirical data analysis of grid frequencies from the Hungarian grid indicates that q-Gaussian distributions best fit simulations, with spatio-temporally correlated noise evident in the frequency spectrum. Comparing European and North American power grids reveals that employing homogeneous transmission capacities to represent power lines can lead to misleading results on stability, and nodal behavior is heterogeneous. Community structures of the continent-sized grids are detected, demonstrating that Chimera states are more likely to occur when studying only subsystems. A topographical analysis of the grids is presented to assist in selecting such subsystems. Finally, synchronization calculations are provided to illustrate the occurrence of Chimera states. The findings underscore the necessity of heterogeneous grid models for dynamic stability analysis of power systems.","[Hartmann, Balint] HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Energy Secur & Environm Safety, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Odor, Geza; Papp, Istvan; Deng, Shengfeng] HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Benedek, Kristof] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Muegyetem Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Deng, Shengfeng] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Informat Technol, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Kelling, Jeffrey] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fac Nat Sci, Inst Chem, Str Nationen 62, D-09111 Chemnitz, Germany; [Kelling, Jeffrey] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiat Phys, POB 51 01 19, D-01314 Dresden, Germany",Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Shaanxi Normal University; Technische Universitat Chemnitz; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR),"Hartmann, B (corresponding author), HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Energy Secur & Environm Safety, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary.",hartmann.balint@ek.hun-ren.hu; odor@mfa.kfki.hu,,,"Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH [K146736]; ELKH grant [SA-44/2021]; Bolyai Janos Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); ELKH grant; Bolyai Janos Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences)","Support from the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH (K146736) and from the ELKH grant SA-44/2021 is acknowledged.

In an adversarial scenario, the graph may be manipulated to avoid scrutiny of certain nodes by the analyst. Robustness to such behaviour is an important consideration for data analysts in high-stakes scenarios such as cyber defense and counterterrorism. In this paper, we evaluate the use of overlapping community detection methods in the presence of adversarial attacks aimed at lowering the priority of a specific vertex. We formulate the data analyst's choice as a Stackelberg game in which the analyst chooses a community detection method and the attacker chooses an attack strategy in response. Applying various attacks from the literature to nine real network datasets, we find that, when the attacker has a sufficient budget, overlapping community detection methods outperform non-overlapping methods, often overwhelmingly so. This is the case when the attacker can only add edges that connect to the target and when the capability is added to add edges between neighbours of the target. We also analyze the tradeoff between robustness in the presence of an attack and performance when there is no attack. Our extensible analytic framework enables network data analysts to take these considerations into account and incorporate new attacks and community detection methods as they are developed.","[Miller, Benjamin A.] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chan, Kevin] DEVCOM Army Res Lab, Network Cyber, Computat Sci Div, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, Adelphi, MD 20783 USA; [Eliassi-Rad, Tina] Northeastern Univ, Khoury Coll Comp Sci, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Miller, BA (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",miller.be@northeastern.edu,,,United States Air Force under Air Force [FA8702-15-D-0001]; Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-13-2-0045],United States Air Force under Air Force; Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory,"United States Air Force under Air Force Contract No. FA8702-15-D-0001 Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory (under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-13-2-0045).

Its principal objectives are reduction of systematic biases primarily introduced through technical sources and transformation of counts to make them more amenable for the application of established statistical frameworks. In the standard workflows, normalization is followed by feature selection to identify highly variable genes (HVGs) that capture most of the biologically meaningful variation across the cells. Here, we make the case for a revised workflow by proposing a simple feature selection method and showing that we can perform feature selection before normalization by relying on observed counts. We highlight that the feature selection step can be used to not only select HVGs but to also identify stable genes.

However, existing spatial clustering methods often fail to exploit the full potential of spatial information, resulting in inaccurate identification of spatial domains.Results In this article, we develop a deep graph contrastive clustering framework, stDGCC, that accurately uncovers underlying spatial domains via explicitly modeling spatial information and gene expression profiles from spatial transcriptomics data. The stDGCC framework proposes a spatially informed graph node embedding model to preserve the topological information of spots and to learn the informative and discriminative characterization of spatial transcriptomics data through self-supervised contrastive learning. By simultaneously optimizing the contrastive learning loss, reconstruction loss, and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, stDGCC achieves joint optimization of feature learning and topology structure preservation in an end-to-end manner. We validate the effectiveness of stDGCC on various spatial transcriptomics datasets acquired from different platforms, each with varying spatial resolutions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of stDGCC over various state-of-the-art clustering methods in accurately identifying cellular-level biological structures.Availability and implementation Code and data are available from https://github.com/TimE9527/stDGCC and https://figshare.com/projects/stDGCC/186525.","[Zhang, Yingxi; Yu, Zhuohan; Li, Xiangtao] Jilin Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, 3003 Qianjin Ave, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wong, Ka-Chun] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",Jilin University; City University of Hong Kong,"Li, XT (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, 3003 Qianjin Ave, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.",lixt314@jlu.edu.cn,,"WONG, Ka Chun/0000-0001-6062-733X; Li, Xiangtao/0000-0002-8716-9823",Jilin Province Outstanding Young Scientist Program [20230508098RC]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076109],Jilin Province Outstanding Young Scientist Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Jilin Province Outstanding Young Scientist Program [20230508098RC]; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076109].,,46,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1367-4803,1367-4811,,BIOINFORMATICS,Bioinformatics,JUL 25,2024,40.0,7,,,,,,,btae451,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae451,0.0,,,12,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,ZO6U4,39012523.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001276286500002,0

The central flow theory suggests that the mega-city regions are formed by the interconnected flows of people across cities, making the spatial synergy can be measured by assessing the aggregation and intensity of flows and interactions between cities and regions. Human mobility data, such as mobile phone data and social media check-ins, enable the tracking of human movements, thus facilitating the transition of central flow theory from theoretical constructs to empirical research. To this end, this study presents an alternative data-driven framework to reveal the multi-scale spatial synergy of mega-city regions from a human mobility perspective. It uncovers homogeneously spatial communities with high inter-city integration using community detection. Strong internal spatial connections of 2.13 billion mobility are filtered using network backbone extraction. An experiment in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, demonstrates a multi-scale and multi-core hierarchical spatial synergy in the PRD region. The detailed findings are as follows: (1) Three cities attract the majority of human mobility. Mobility distance is short in urban centers and long in suburban areas. (2) The spatial integration pattern shows the detected communities reveal the hierarchical integration pattern with three main integrated regions: Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing, Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou, and Zhuhai-Zhongshan-Jiangmen. (3) The spatial connection pattern illustrates the close ties of 9 cities and three core cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan. These results provide a human-centric understanding of urban synergy and deeper insights into central flow theory, which supports cooperative development in mega-city regions.","[Fang, Bichen; Li, Mingxiao; Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Fang, Bichen; Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Dept Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Mingxiao; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei] Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Mingxiao; Huang, Zhengdong; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Smart Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei] State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg & Urban Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Guo, Renzhong] MNR, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Great Bay Area, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University,"Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Smart Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",limx@szu.edu.cn,,"Li, Mingxiao/0000-0003-0779-4432","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071360, 42311530335, 42101463]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB2103104]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20220818100200001, ZDSYS20210623101800001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program,"This study is supported and funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 42071360, 42311530335, and 42101463]; National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2019YFB2103104]; and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [grant number JCYJ20220818100200001, ZDSYS20210623101800001].

Through a systematic literature search, we compiled a dataset of naturally occurring zoonotic interactions in Austria, spanning 1975-2022. We introduce the concept of zoonotic web to describe the complex relationships between zoonotic agents, their hosts, vectors, food, and environmental sources. The zoonotic web was explored through network analysis. After controlling for research effort, we demonstrate that, within the projected unipartite source-source network of zoonotic agent sharing, the most influential zoonotic sources are human, cattle, chicken, and some meat products. Analysis of the One Health 3-cliques (triangular sets of nodes representing human, animal, and environment) confirms the increased probability of zoonotic spillover at human-cattle and human-food interfaces. We characterise six communities of zoonotic agent sharing, which assembly patterns are likely driven by highly connected infectious agents in the zoonotic web, proximity to human, and anthropogenic activities. Additionally, we report a frequency of emerging zoonotic diseases in Austria of one every six years. Here, we present a flexible network-based approach that offers insights into zoonotic transmission chains, facilitating the development of locally-relevant One Health strategies against zoonoses. Zoonotic disease systems comprise complex dynamics between multiple animal hosts, vectors, environmental and food sources, and humans. In this study, the authors characterise this 'zoonotic web' for the case study of Austria by performing network analyses of published zoonotic disease reports.","[Desvars-Larrive, Amelie; Vogl, Anna Elisabeth; Puspitarani, Gavrila Amadea; Kaesbohrer, Annemarie] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Ctr Food Sci & Vet Publ Hlth, Clin Dept Farm Anim & Food Syst Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Desvars-Larrive, Amelie; Puspitarani, Gavrila Amadea; Yang, Liuhuaying] Complex Sci Hub, Vienna, Austria; [Joachim, Anja] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Ctr Pathobiol, Dept Biol Sci & Pathobiol, Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Desvars-Larrive, A (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Ctr Food Sci & Vet Publ Hlth, Clin Dept Farm Anim & Food Syst Sci, Vienna, Austria.;Desvars-Larrive, A (corresponding author), Complex Sci Hub, Vienna, Austria.",amelie.desvars@vetmeduni.ac.at,,"Puspitarani, Gavrila Amadea/0000-0002-8826-5606; Vogl, Anna Elisabeth/0009-0007-9813-3854; Kaesbohrer, Annemarie/0000-0003-2966-2713; Desvars-Larrive, Amelie/0000-0001-7671-696X",,,"DAS:The raw dataset generated in this study, as well as its cleaned and validated version, are available in the Supplementary Code.

Study Design and Setting: Using cross-sectional self-reported data on 24 diseases from 30,097 community-living adults aged 45 e 85 from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we conducted network analyses using 5 clustering methods and 11 association measures commonly used in multimorbidity studies. We compared the similarity among clusters using the adjusted Rand index (ARI); an ARI of 0 is equivalent to the diseases being randomly assigned to clusters, and 1 indicates perfect agreement. We compared the network analysis results to disease clusters independently identified by two clinicians. Results: Results differed greatly across combinations of association measures and cluster algorithms. The number of clusters identified ranged from 1 to 24, with a low similarity of conditions within clusters. Compared to clinician-derived clusters, ARIs ranged from- 0.02 to 0.24, indicating little similarity. Conclusion: These analyses demonstrate the need for a systematic evaluation of the performance of network analysis methods on binary clustered data like diseases. Moreover, in individual older adults, diseases may not cluster predictably, highlighting the need for a personalized approach to their care. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

To help improve the current breast cancer comorbidity identification by medical personnel and ultimately, lower the number of death cases from breast cancer comorbidity, this research aims to discover the breast cancer comorbidity community, do modularity and similarity-based evaluation, suggest the best semantic similarity measurement and threshold value, and validate the data of breast cancer comorbidities with several data from research papers. The Wang algorithm, with a threshold value of 0.5, is chosen to build the network. Leiden, Louvain, RBER Pots, RB Pots, and Walktrap are the best five community detection algorithms. Similarity measurements with the best three fitness functions (edges inside, scaled density, and size) suggest that the Leiden-Louvain algorithm and RBER Pots-RB Pots algorithm are two pairs of algorithms with similar results. Other similarity measurements with the V-measure heatmap suggest that Louvain-Leiden (0.99), RB Pots-Leiden (0.97), and RB Pots-RBER Pots (0.96) results are similar. Comorbidity is then evaluated using the best five community detection algorithms and four centrality algorithms. As a result, fourteen diseases are agreed upon by the best five community detection algorithms, five diseases are agreed by four algorithms, two diseases are agreed by three algorithms, a disease is agreed by two algorithms, and ten diseases are agreed by an algorithm.","[Permana, Angga A.; Yaputra, Reynard M.] Univ Multimedia Nusantara, Fac Engn & Informat, Dept Informat, Jl Blvd, Tangerang 15810, Banten, Indonesia",Multimedia Nusantara University,"Permana, AA (corresponding author), Univ Multimedia Nusantara, Fac Engn & Informat, Dept Informat, Jl Blvd, Tangerang 15810, Banten, Indonesia.",angga.permana@umn.ac.id,,,Universitas Multimedia Nusantara,Universitas Multimedia Nusantara,"Thank you to Universitas Multimedia Nusantara for the continuous support of this research.

It presents new avenues for comprehending tissue organization. In this context, the ability to assign detected RNA transcripts to individual cells is crucial for downstream analyses, such as in-situ cell type calling. Yet, accurate cell segmentation can be challenging in tissue data, in particular in the absence of a high-quality membrane marker. To address this issue, we introduce ComSeg, a segmentation algorithm that operates directly on single RNA positions and that does not come with implicit or explicit priors on cell shape. ComSeg is applicable in complex tissues with arbitrary cell shapes.

To measure the structural entropy of a dynamic graph, we need to decode the optimal encoding tree corresponding to the best community partitioning for each snapshot. However, the current methods do not support dynamic encoding tree updating and incremental structural entropy computation. To address this issue, we propose Incre-2dSE , a novel incremental measurement framework that dynamically adjusts the community partitioning and efficiently computes the updated structural entropy for each updated graph. Specifically, Incre-2dSE includes incremental algorithms based on two dynamic adjustment strategies for two-dimensional encoding trees, i.e., the naive adjustment strategy and the node-shifting adjustment strategy , which support theoretical analysis of updated structural entropy and incrementally optimize community partitioning towards a lower structural entropy. We conduct extensive experiments on 3 artificial datasets generated by Hawkes Process and 3 real-world datasets. Experimental results confirm that our incremental algorithms effectively capture the dynamic evolution of the communities, reduce time consumption, and provide great interpretability.","[Yang, Runze; Li, Angsheng] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Peng, Hao] Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chunyang] Didi Chuxing, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University,"Peng, H (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",penghao@buaa.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFB3104703]; NSFC [62322202, 61932002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4222030]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2023B1515120020]; CCF-DiDi GAIA Collaborative Research Funds for Young Scholars; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Key R&D Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; CCF-DiDi GAIA Collaborative Research Funds for Young Scholars; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China through grant 2022YFB3104703, NSFC through grants 62322202 and 61932002, Beijing Natural Science Foundation through grant 4222030, Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation through grant 2023B1515120020, CCF-DiDi GAIA Collaborative Research Funds for Young Scholars, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,41,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0004-3702,1872-7921,,ARTIF INTELL-AMST,Artif.

Eighteen algorithms are systematically evaluated, including state-of-the-art and benchmark methods for identifying overlapping and disjoint groups. Using discussions from five prominent English hacker forums, a comparative analysis examines the influence of the algorithms' theoretical foundations on community detection. Since ground truths are unattainable for such networks, the study utilizes a multimetric strategy, incorporating modularity, coverage, performance, and a newly introduced quality measure, Triplet Hub Potential, which quantifies the presence of influential hubs. The findings reveal that while modularity optimization algorithms such as Leiden and Louvain deliver consistent results, neighbor-based expanding techniques tend to provide superior performance. In particular, the Expansion algorithm stood out by uncovering granular hierarchical community structures. The ability to investigate these intimacies is helpful for CTI researchers. Ultimately, we suggest an approach to investigate hacker forums using community detection methods and encourage the future development of algorithms tailored to expose nuances within hacker networks.","[Manatova, Dalyapraz] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [DeVries, Charles] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Samtani, Sagar] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Carnegie Mellon University; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Manatova, D (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dmanato@iu.edu; csdevrie@iu.edu; ssamtani@iu.edu,,,"National Sci-ence Foundation, USA [OAC-1917117, CNS-2338479, DGE-1946537, OAC-2319325, CNS-1850362]","National Sci-ence Foundation, USA(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the National Sci-ence Foundation, USA under Grant No. OAC-1917117, CNS-2338479, DGE-1946537, OAC-2319325, and CNS-1850362.",,75,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-9236,1873-5797,,DECIS SUPPORT SYST,Decis.

In recent years, spatial community detection has attracted extensive research in the field of geographic information science. However, mining the community structures and their evolutionary patterns from spatial interaction data remains challenging. Most existing methods for spatial community detection rely on representing spatial interaction networks in Euclidean space, which results in significant distortion when modeling spatial interaction networks; since spatial community detection has no ground truth, this results in the detection and evaluation of communities being difficult. Furthermore, most methods usually ignore the dynamics of these spatial interaction networks, resulting in the dynamic evolution of spatial communities not being discussed in depth. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for community detection and evolutionary analysis for spatial interaction networks. Specifically, we construct a spatial interaction network based on network science theory, where geographic units serve as nodes and interaction relationships serve as edges. In order to fully learn the structural features of the spatial interaction network, we introduce a hyperbolic graph convolution module in the community detection phase to learn the spatial and non-spatial attributes of the spatial interaction network, obtain vector representations of the nodes, and optimize them based on a graph generation model to achieve the final community detection results. Considering the dynamics of spatial interactions, we analyze the evolution of the spatial community over time. Finally, using taxi trajectory data as an example, we conduct relevant experiments within the fifth ring road of Beijing. The empirical results validate the community detection capabilities of the proposed method, which can effectively describe the dynamic spatial structure of cities based on human mobility and provide an effective analytical method for urban spatial planning.","[Liu, Huimin; Yang, Qiu; Yang, Xuexi; Tang, Jianbo; Deng, Min; Gui, Rong] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Huimin; Yang, Xuexi; Tang, Jianbo; Deng, Min] Hunan Geospatial Informat Engn & Technol Res Ctr, Changsha 410018, Peoples R China; [Deng, Min] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R China",Central South University; Jiangxi Normal University,"Gui, R (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",lhmgis@csu.edu.cn; 215011045@csu.edu.cn; yangxuexi@csu.edu.cn; jianbo.tang@csu.edu.cn; dengmin@csu.edu.cn; ronggui@csu.edu.cn,,"Xuexi, Yang/0000-0001-5531-5841","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2022JJ40585]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271485, 42171459]; Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University [2023QYJC002]; Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project [20230121XX]; Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents [jxsq2020102062]",Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University; Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project; Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents,"This research was supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2022JJ40585), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42271485 and 42171459), the Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University (2023QYJC002), the Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project (20230121XX), and the Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents (jxsq2020102062).",,52,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

The rational service areas (RSAs) are defined to represent local healthcare markets and used as the basic units to evaluate whether people have access to health resources. Therefore, finding an appropriate way to develop RSAs is important for understanding the utilization of health resources and supporting accurate resource allocation to the health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Existing RSAs are usually developed based on the local knowledge of public health needs and are created through time-intensive manual work by health service officials. In this research, a travel data-driven and spatially constrained community detection method based on human mobility flow is proposed to automate the process of establishing the statewide RSAs and further identifying HPSAs based on healthcare criteria in a geographic information system (GIS) software. The proposed method considers the difference between rural and urban populations by assigning different parameters and delineates RSAs with the goal of reducing health resource inequalities faced by rural areas. Using the data in the State of Wisconsin, our experiment shows that the proposed RSA delineation method outperforms other baselines including the traditional Dartmouth method in the aspects of RSA compactness, region size balances, and health shortage scores. Furthermore, the whole process of delineating RSAs and identifying HPSAs is automated using Python toolboxes in ArcGIS to support future analyses and practices in a timely and repeatable manner.","[Liang, Yunlei; Gao, Song] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, GeoDS Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gao, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, GeoDS Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",song.gao@wisc.edu,"Gao, Song/N-9573-2019","Gao, Song/0000-0003-4359-6302",,,"We would like to thank the SafeGraph Inc. for providing the data about anonymous location visits and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services Primary Care Program for providing the health resource data and thank Aleksandr Kladnitsky, Regina Vidaver, Penny Black, and Jaime Olson for their guidance on this research.",,31,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-1682,1467-9671,,T GIS,Trans.

To understand the spatiotemporal variability and bottom-up spontaneity of the diffusion of clean energy technologies, this study examined the spatiotemporal diffusion of Photovoltaic (PV) systems, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) across 1773 postcode areas in California over the past 35 years. The Bayesian change point detection algorithm (BCDA) was initially utilized to identify temporal change points in the evolution of these technologies, revealing their diffusion trends over time. Then, the Louvain community detection algorithm (LCDA) was employed to elucidate spatial diffusion patterns across regions, offering insights into the geographic proliferation of clean energy solutions. Furthermore, to forecast future distributions, the spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) model was applied, adeptly capturing the multi-stage, nonlinear characteristics of clean energy diffusion marked by significant spatiotemporal interactions. With historical data and spatial proximity, the STGCN model demonstrated fine forecasting precision (R<^>2 >= 0.78). This study validates the effectiveness of a graph network-based approach for analyzing the diffusion of clean energy technologies. It recommends policies tailored to account for technological maturity, geographic disparities, and diffusion stages, aiming for equitable and sustainable clean energy development in the region.","[Lan, Haifeng; Hou, Huiying (Cynthia)] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gou, Zhonghua] Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Urban Dev, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Wuhan University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Hou, HY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cynthia.hou@polyu.edu.hk,,"Hou, Cynthia/0000-0002-4215-2673","Hong Kong Polytechnic University: Start-up Fund for New Recruits [P0040305]; General Research Fund [15603920, 15609421]; Collaborative Research Fund [C5062-21GF]; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong, China; Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China [1-GD81]","Hong Kong Polytechnic University: Start-up Fund for New Recruits; General Research Fund; Collaborative Research Fund; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China","We acknowledge the California Distributed Generation Statistics group (CADGS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the US Department of Energy (NREL) for providing open-source data that was used in this study.

The expense of supporting patients with ASD turns into a significant problem for society. Parsing neurobiological subtypes is a crucial way for delineating the heterogeneity in autistic brains, with significant implications for improving ASD diagnosis and promoting the development of personalized intervention models. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity in cortical morphology of ASD is still lacking, and the question of whether neuroanatomical subtypes remain stable during cortical development remains unclear. Here, we used T1-weighted images of 515 male patients with ASD, including 216 autistic children (6-11 years), 187 adolescents (12-17 years), and 112 young adults (18-29 years), along with 595 age and gender-matched typically developing (TD) individuals. Cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and volumes of cortical (CV) and subcortical (SV) regions were extracted. A single network layer was established by calculating the covariance of each feature across brain regions between participants, thereby constructing a multilayer intersubject covariance network. Applying a community detection algorithm to multilayer networks derived from different feature combinations, we observed that the network comprising CT and CV layers exhibited the most prominent modular organization, resulting in three subtypes of ASD for each of the three age groups. Subtypes within the corresponding age group significantly differed in terms of brain morphology and clinical scales. Furthermore, the subtypes of children with ASD underwent reorganization with development, transitioning from childhood to adolescence and adulthood, rather than consistently persist. Additionally, subtype categorization largely improved the diagnostic accuracy of ASD compared to diagnosing the entire ASD cohort. These findings demonstrated distinct neuroanatomical manifestations of ASD subtypes across various developmental periods, highlighting the significance of age-related subtyping in facilitating the etiology and diagnosis of ASD.","[Fu, Xiang; Wang, Ying; Li, Jialong; Zhang, Xinyan; Yao, Zhijun; Yang, Minqiang; Zheng, Weihao] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Gansu Prov Key Lab Wearable Comp, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Cai, Hongmin] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; South China University of Technology,"Yang, MQ; Zheng, WH (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Gansu Prov Key Lab Wearable Comp, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",fux2019@lzu.edu.cn; wangying22@lzu.edu.cn; 220220942951@lzu.edu.cn; hmcai@scut.edu.cn; 120220909261@lzu.edu.cn; yaozj@lzu.edu.cn; yangmq@lzu.edu.cn; zhengweihao@lzu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Minqiang/0000-0002-7571-6439; Zheng, Weihao/0000-0003-2996-5909; Cai, Hongmin/0000-0002-2747-7234","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U21A20520, 62202212, 62227807]; STI2030-Major Projects [2021ZD0202002, 2021ZD0200800]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0706200]; Science and Technology Program of Gansu Province [23YFGA0004, 23JRRA1136]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); STI2030-Major Projects; National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Science and Technology Program of Gansu Province,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U21A20520, Grant 62202212, and Grant 62227807; in part by the STI2030-Major Projects under Grant 2021ZD0202002 and Grant 2021ZD0200800; in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFA0706200; and in part by the Science and Technology Program of Gansu Province under Grant 23YFGA0004 and Grant 23JRRA1136.",,74,0,0,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Current research on scientists' mobility focuses on aggregated levels such as inter-country mobility, with little attention paid to fine-grained institutional level, leading to a simplified spatial portrayal of the mobility. To fill the gap, we take scientists in geography as examples, and reconstructed their dynamic mobility network among institutions from 1970 to 2020 based on massive literature metadata. Our findings reveal the spatial mobility pattern that is now dominated by North America, Western and Northern Europe, East Asia, and Oceania, with the trend of intensification, multipolarity, and inequality over time. Specifically, the mobility network exhibits clear community structure largely constrained by spatial proximity and national borders. We also uncovered a universal downward mobility pattern embedded in the hierarchical structure. Our quantitative analysis further suggest that mobility is facilitated by multiple realities, including spatial, cultural, and scientific proximity, institutional rankings and national economic levels, cooperation, and visa-free policies, with varying dynamics. These results contribute to spatiotemporal insights into the mechanisms of scientific development in theory, and the basis for talent policymaking in practice.","[Liu, Tianyu; Pei, Tao; Fang, Zidong; Wu, Mingbo; Liu, Xiaohan; Yan, Xiaorui; Song, Ci; Jiang, Jingyu; Chen, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tianyu; Pei, Tao; Fang, Zidong; Wu, Mingbo; Liu, Xiaohan; Yan, Xiaorui; Song, Ci] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pei, Tao] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jingyu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Linfeng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University; Lanzhou University","Pei, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Pei, T (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Pei, T (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",peit@lreis.ac.cn,,"Yan, Xiaorui/0000-0002-4174-0561",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071436]; Innovation Project of LREIS [KPI002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Project of LREIS,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 42071436] and the Innovation Project of LREIS [Grant No. KPI002].,,46,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1365-8816,1362-3087,,INT J GEOGR INF SCI,Int.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm where multiple clients can collaboratively train a defect detection model in a privacy-preserving manner. A prevalent issue in FL, concept drift, is discussed in this article. Feature representations of the same label may vary at different clients which affects the performance of FL. To address this issue, a novel community aware personalized federated learning (CA-PFL) is proposed in this article. A graph structured federation social network is constructed with local model updates. Communities in federation network are discovered with community detection to ensure that the same label at different clients have similar representations in each community. Shared layers of local models are aggregated in each community and each local client keeps their personalized layers. Furthermore, a federation community contrastive loss (FedCCL) is proposed to accelerate training convergence by constraining the direction of local model updating. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that CA-PFL achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than state-of- the-art personalized federated learning methods in concept drifts scenarios.","[Zhao, Hongwei; Liu, Qiyuan; Sun, Haoyun; Zhang, Weishan; Zhao, Yikang] China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongwei; Liu, Qiyuan; Sun, Haoyun; Zhang, Weishan; Zhao, Yikang] Shandong Data Open Innovat Applicat Lab, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang] Beijing Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao 266114, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; University of Science & Technology Beijing; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, WS (corresponding author), China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.",zhw@s.upc.edu.cn; upcedc670@163.com; hys_upc@163.com; xuliang.upc.edu@gmail.com; zhangws@upc.edu.cn; yikang_zhao0815@s.upc.edu.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn,,"Zhao, Hongwei/0000-0001-5235-0748; Zhang, Weishan/0000-0001-9800-1068",National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072469]; Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2023MF041],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072469, in part by Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2023MF041.",,57,0,0,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

To meet the needs of processing large networks in today's world, it is important to propose fast methods that have low execution time and fast convergence speed, while maintaining algorithmic accuracy. To overcome these issues, a fast local multi-factor node scoring and label selection-based (LMFLS) method with low time complexity and fast convergence is proposed. Node scoring step incorporates diverse metrics to better assess impact of nodes from different aspects and obtain more meaningful order of nodes. In second step, to construct and stabilize initial structure of communities, an efficient label assignment technique based on the selection of the most similar neighbor is suggested. Moreover, two label selection strategies are proposed to significantly enhance the accuracy and improve convergence of the algorithm. During the label selection step, each node in graph tends to choose the most appropriate label based on a multi-criteria label influence from its surrounding nodes. Finally, by utilizing a novel merge method, small group of nodes are merged to form the final communities. Meanwhile, since drug repositioning is one of the popular research fields in therapeutics, to extend the application of the proposed algorithm in practical context, the LMFLS algorithm is applied on Drug-Drug network to find potential repositioning for drugs. Thorough experiments are conducted on both actual real-world networks and synthetic networks to assess the algorithm's performance and accuracy. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and execution time.","[Li, Huxiong; Gheisari, Mehdi; Wu, Zongda] Shaoxing Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Nasab, Samaneh Salehi] Lorestan Univ, Dept Engn, Aleshtar Campus, Aleshtar, Iran; [Roghani, Hamid] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Roghani, Parya] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran; [Fernandez-Campusano, Christian] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 9170124, Chile; [Abbasi, Aaqif Afzaal] Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Gheisari, Mehdi] Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai 602105, Tamilnadu, India; [Gheisari, Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Gheisari, Mehdi] Shenzhen BKD Co LTD, Dept R&D, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shaoxing University; Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University; Islamic Azad University; Universidad de Santiago de Chile; University of Palermo; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha School of Engineering; Islamic Azad University,"Gheisari, M; Wu, ZD (corresponding author), Shaoxing Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Gheisari, M (corresponding author), Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai 602105, Tamilnadu, India.;Gheisari, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran.;Gheisari, M (corresponding author), Shenzhen BKD Co LTD, Dept R&D, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",2019000060@usx.edu.cn; salehinasab.s@lu.ac.ir; h.roghani@azaruniv.ac.ir; mehdi.gheisari61@gmail.com; zongda1983@163.com,"Fern√°ndez-Campusano, Christian/M-8749-2018; Roghani, Hamid/GYV-0955-2022","Fern√°ndez-Campusano, Christian/0000-0001-7033-4178; Roghani, Hamid/0000-0002-8084-5075","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62341208]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY23F020006, LR23F020001]; Islamic Azad Unviersity, Iran [133713281361]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Islamic Azad Unviersity, Iran","Acknowledgement This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62341208) , Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant Nos.

Whether dealing with single-cell transcriptomic or spatial transcriptomic data, dimensionality reduction and clustering are indispensable. Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data are often high-dimensional, making the analysis and visualization of such data challenging. Through dimensionality reduction, it becomes possible to visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space, allowing for the observation of relationships and differences between cell subpopulations. Clustering enables the grouping of similar cells into the same cluster, aiding in the identification of distinct cell subpopulations and revealing cellular diversity, providing guidance for downstream analyses. In this review, we systematically summarized the most widely recognized algorithms employed for the dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and spatial transcriptomic data. This endeavor provides valuable insights and ideas that can contribute to the development of novel tools in this rapidly evolving field.","[Sun, Yidi; Kong, Lingling; Huang, Jiayi; Deng, Hongyan; Bian, Xinling; Li, Xingfeng; Cui, Feifei; Zhang, Zilong] Hainan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China; [Dou, Lijun] Lerner Res Inst, Genom Med Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Cao, Chen] Nanjing Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn & Informat, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Zou, Quan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Zou, Quan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Yangtze Delta Reg Inst Quzhou, Quzhou 324000, Peoples R China",Hainan University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Nanjing Medical University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Zhang, ZL (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China.;Zou, Q (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.;Zou, Q (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Yangtze Delta Reg Inst Quzhou, Quzhou 324000, Peoples R China.",23110810000011@hainanu.edu.cn; 20223003432@hainanu.edu.cn; 20213006619@hainanu.edu.cn; 20223003536@hainanu.edu.cn; 20223003548@hainanu.edu.cn; lixingfeng@hainanu.edu.cn; feifeicui@hainanu.edu.cn; doul2@ccf.org; caochen@njmu.edu.cn; zouquan@nclab.net; zhangzilong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Zou, Quan/A-7801-2015","Zou, Quan/0000-0001-6406-1142; Cui, Feifei/0000-0001-7055-3813","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62131004, 62102064, 62261018]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 62131004, 62102064, 62261018).",,58,0,0,7,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2649,2041-2657,,BRIEF FUNCT GENOMICS,Brief.

Community detection methods often define communities as dense subgraphs, or subgraphs with few connections in-between, via concepts such as the cut, conductance, or modularity. Here we consider another perspective built on the notion of local dominance, where low-degree nodes are assigned to the basin of influence of high-degree nodes, and design an efficient algorithm based on local information. Local dominance gives rises to community centers, and uncovers local hierarchies in the network. Community centers have a larger degree than their neighbors and are sufficiently distant from other centers. The strength of our framework is demonstrated on synthesized and empirical networks with ground-truth community labels. The notion of local dominance and the associated asymmetric relations between nodes are not restricted to community detection, and can be utilised in clustering problems, as we illustrate on networks derived from vector data. Community detection has been studied for more than 20 years, but a perspective from community center is still missing and most algorithms need global information. The authors propose a linear algorithm based on local information to identify centers and related hierarchical structure for effective community detection, which can enhance clustering vector data as well.","[Shi, Dingyi; Shang, Fan; Chen, Bingsheng; Li, Ruiqi] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, UrbanNet Lab, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bingsheng; Evans, Tim S.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Complex Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Chen, Bingsheng] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Bingsheng] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Expert, Paul] Univ Coll London UCL, Global Business Sch Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Lue, Linyuan] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Stanley, H.

Nevertheless, edges, serving as conduits for information dissemination, hold significant importance. Mining critical edges in networks can serve as a valuable target for both network disassembly as an attack strategy and network preservation as a defensive measure. This paper introduces the k-sup structure by taking into account the strength of relationships between nodes and investigates the critical subgraph based on the k-sup structure. Furthermore, this paper distinguishes between the significance of inter-community edges and intra-community edges, proposing an importance indicator based on the k-sup structure. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed indicator, comparative experiments are conducted with seven classic edge importance indicators on eight real-world network datasets and three synthetic network datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed indicator assesses their importance, exhibiting superiority over alternative methods in terms of network connectivity.","[Zhao, Mengyao; Zhai, Yanhui; Li, Deyu] Shanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Yanhui; Li, Deyu] Shanxi Univ, Key Lab Computat Intelligence & Chinese Informat P, Minist Educ, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China",Shanxi University; Shanxi University,"Zhai, YH (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.;Zhai, YH (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Key Lab Computat Intelligence & Chinese Informat P, Minist Educ, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.",yao505269507@163.com; chai_yanhui@163.com; lidysxu@163.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-8542,1573-0484,,J SUPERCOMPUT,J.

Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the classification of cells into distinct types. Many approaches build on existing clustering literature to develop tools specific to single-cell. However, almost all of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters to control the number of clusters. This affects both the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as well as their replicability across datasets. While many recommendations exist, in general, there is little assurance that any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in the trade-off between cluster resolution and replicability. For instance, another set of parameters may result in more clusters that are also more replicable.Results Here, we propose Dune, a new method for optimizing the trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their replicability. Our method takes as input a set of clustering results-or partitions-on a single dataset and iteratively merges clusters within each partitions in order to maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on multiple datasets from different platforms, Dune outperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of replicability of the resultant merged clusters as well as concordance with ground truth. Dune is available as an R package on Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Dune.html.Conclusions Cluster refinement by Dune helps improve the robustness of any clustering analysis and reduces the reliance on tuning parameters. This method provides an objective approach for borrowing information across multiple clusterings to generate replicable clusters most likely to represent common biological features across multiple datasets.","[Van den Berge, Koen; Purdom, Elizabeth; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Street, Kelly] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Populat & Publ Hlth Sci, Div Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Fischer, Stephan; Gillis, Jesse] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY USA; [Van den Berge, Koen] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium; [Chance, Rebecca; Ngai, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA USA; [Risso, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Padua, Italy; [de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Purdom, Elizabeth; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Computat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Southern California; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Ghent University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Padua; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Computat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sandrine@berkeley.edu,,,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO),We thank Quentin Dumont and Frank Herbert [35] for inspiration for the Dune name.,,40,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,MAY 24,2024,25.0,1,,,,,,,198,10.1186/s12859-024-05814-6,0.0,,,19,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,SD4U4,38789920.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001232515000001,0

The linear clustering process produces clusters or partitions based on the eigenstructure of a linear operator on a graph that replaces nodes to 'more natural' positions by attractive and repulsive forces. Synthetic benchmarks, along with real-world networks possessing or lacking a known community structure, are considered. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that our linear clustering process generates superior partitions compared to the algorithms assessed in most instances, while of comparable computational complexity with the simplest existing clustering algorithms.","[Jokic, Ivan; Wang, Beichen; Van Mieghem, Piet] Math & Comp Sci, POB 5031, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",,"Wang, BC (corresponding author), Math & Comp Sci, POB 5031, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",kaka19980625@hotmail.com,,"Jokic, Ivan/0000-0001-6392-1841; Van Mieghem, Piet/0000-0002-3786-7922",,,,,30,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1310,2051-1329,,J COMPLEX NETW,J.

The network was originally assumed to be made up of three communities, which the algorithms were able to further divide into smaller groupings. The Louvain approach produced the most balanced distribution of community sizes, with skewness and kurtosis values close to zero, implying that the detected communities were reasonably evenly distributed in size and without major outliers. However, the Louvain algorithm found 25 communities, which is more than the network's previously reported three communities. Further investigation may be required to integrate some of these communities in order to obtain the original known communities. Overall, this study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate community detection algorithm for a given network and research question.","[Joram, Arun; Singh, Karam Ratan] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Basic & Appl Sci, Jote 791113, Arunachal Prade, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Arunachal Pradesh,"Singh, KR (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Basic & Appl Sci, Jote 791113, Arunachal Prade, India.",arunjoram23@gmail.com; karamratan7@gmail.com,,"Joram, Arun/0000-0001-9543-8176",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",1793-8309,1793-8317,,DISCRET MATH ALGORIT,Discret.

Although deep learning models-especially variational autoencoders-have been widely used to capture low-dimensional feature embeddings, the prevalent Gaussian assumption somewhat disagrees with real data, and these models tend to struggle to incorporate reference information from abundant cell atlases. Here we propose CASTLE, a deep generative model based on the vector-quantized variational autoencoder framework to extract discrete latent embeddings that interpretably characterize single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data. We validate the performance and robustness of CASTLE for accurate cell-type identification and reasonable visualization compared with state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the advantages of CASTLE for effective incorporation of existing massive reference datasets in a weakly supervised or supervised manner. We further demonstrate CASTLE's capacity for intuitively distilling cell-type-specific feature spectra that unveil cell heterogeneity and biological implications quantitatively. A method based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder, called CASTLE, can interpretably extract discrete latent embeddings and quantitatively generate the cell-type-specific feature spectrum for single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data.","[Cui, Xuejian; Chen, Xiaoyang; Li, Zhen; Gao, Zijing; Jiang, Rui] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Minist Educ,Dept Automat,Key Lab Bioinformat,Bioin, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shengquan] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shengquan] Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Jiang, R (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Minist Educ,Dept Automat,Key Lab Bioinformat,Bioin, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",chenshengquan@nankai.edu.cn; ruijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"chen, sq/JFA-5688-2023; cui, xuejian/IQT-7707-2023","chen, sq/0000-0002-3503-9306; Li, Zhen/0000-0002-3013-3416; Chen, Xiaoyang/0000-0002-7356-8129; Cui, Xuejian/0009-0007-8145-212X","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China grant nos. 2021YFF1200902, 2023YFF1204802, the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants no. 62273194.

Design/methodology/approach - The Scopus database was used to collect data on polymer 3D printing papers. This study uses bibliometric approach along with network analytic techniques to identify and discuss the most important countries and their scientific collaboration, compares income groups and analyses keyword trends. Findings - It was found that top research production results from heavy investments in research and development. The USA has the highest number of papers among the high-income countries. However, scientific production in the other two income groups is strongly dominated by China and India. Keyword analysis shows that countries with lower incomes in certain areas, such as composite and bioprinting, have fallen behind other groups over time. International collaborations were suggested as mechanisms for those countries to catch up with the current research trends. The evolution of the research field, which started with a focus on 3D printing processes and shifted to printed part designs and their applications, was discussed. The advancement of the research topic suggests that translational research on polymer 3D printing has been led mainly by research production from higher-income countries and countries with large research and development investments. Originality/value - Previous studies have conducted performance analysis, science mapping and network analysis in the field of 3D printing, but none have focused on global research trends classified by country income.

Modularity-based algorithms identify communities by attempting to maximize the modularity function across network node partitions. Our study assesses the performance of various modularitybased algorithms in obtaining optimal partitions. Our analysis utilizes 104 networks, including both real -world instances from diverse contexts and modular graphs from two families of synthetic benchmarks. We analyze ten inexact modularity-based algorithms against the exact integer programming baseline that globally optimizes modularity. Our comparative analysis includes eight heuristics, two variants of a graph neural network algorithm, and nine variations of the Bayan approximation algorithm. Our findings reveal that the average modularity-based heuristic yields optimal partitions in only 43.9% of the 104 networks analyzed. Graph neural networks and approximate Bayan, on average, achieve optimality on 68.7% and 82.3% of the networks respectively. Additionally, our analysis of three partition similarity metrics exposes substantial dissimilarities between high-modularity sub -optimal partitions and any optimal partition of the networks. We observe that near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of the commonly used modularity-based methods: they rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition even on networks with modular structures. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, we recommend approximate optimization algorithms for a methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits.

Therefore, accurately identifying these influential nodes that play crucial roles in networks is very important. Many methods have been proposed in different fields to solve this issue. This paper focuses on the different types of disassortativity existing in networks and innovatively introduces the concept of disassortativity of the node, namely, the inconsistency between the degree of a node and the degrees of its neighboring nodes, and proposes a measure of disassortativity of the node (DoN) by a step function. Furthermore, the paper analyzes and indicates that in many real-world network applications, such as online social networks, the influence of nodes within the network is often associated with disassortativity of the node and the community boundary structure of the network. Thus, the influential metric of node based on disassortativity and community structure (mDC) is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted in synthetic and real networks, and the performance of the DoN and mDC is validated through network robustness experiments and immune experiment of disease infection. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art centrality measures, the proposed methods (DoN and mDC) exhibits superior identification performance and efficiency, particularly in non-disassortative networks and networks with clear community structures. Furthermore, we find that the DoN and mDC exhibit high stability to network noise and inaccuracies of the network data.","[Wang, Zuxi; Huang, Ruixiang; Yang, Dian; Peng, Yuqiang; Chen, Zhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zuxi; Huang, Ruixiang; Yang, Dian; Chen, Zhong] Natl Key Lab Multispectral Informat Intelligent Pr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zuxi; Huang, Ruixiang; Yang, Dian; Chen, Zhong] Minist Educ China, Key Lab Image Informat Proc & Intelligent Control, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Boyun] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Informat & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Chen, Z (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Chen, Z (corresponding author), Natl Key Lab Multispectral Informat Intelligent Pr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Chen, Z (corresponding author), Minist Educ China, Key Lab Image Informat Proc & Intelligent Control, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",henpacked@hust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [62276107]; National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We gratefully thank the editor and all reviewers for their time spend making their constructive remarks and useful suggestions, which has significantly raised the quality of the manuscript and has enable us to improve the manuscript.

To address the spike-sorting problem, we have been openly developing the Kilosort framework. Here we describe the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a version with substantially improved performance due to clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework that uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate nonstationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We found that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperformed other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions and that Kilosort4 performed best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions. Kilosort4 is a spike-sorting algorithm with improved performance compared to previous versions, owing to the use of a graph-based clustering approach.

Unfortunately, most of them focus on single node attack. Multi -node attack based on MBA (Module based Adaptive) is a promising research vector with great potential in improving efficiency. However, MBA -based node attack typically needs to repetitively consider community structures of large networks during the entire node attack process, which brings significant loss in network reliability and causes computational overheads. In light of this, we propose a novel scheme based on MBA to implement multinode attack, which adopts the Multilevel community partitioning algorithm to overcome the above limitations. We evaluate our scheme on two artificial synthetic networks and four real -world networks with comparison to four widely used node attack schemes, and demonstrate the non -negligible superiority of our scheme over all benchmarks. Especially in the US Powergrid, our scheme can always achieve robustness around 10 times that of other schemes when deleting the same percentage of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve an MBA -based node attack scheme that only needs to execute the community partitioning algorithm once during the entire node deletion process.","[Li, Beibei; Hu, Wei] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Li, BB (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",beibeili@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; weihu@nwpu.edu.cn,,"Li, Beibei/0000-0002-1965-9476",National Natural Science Foundation of China [62074131]; National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFB3100901],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62074131, and in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under grant 2021YFB3100901.",,49,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-1286,1872-7069,,COMPUT NETW,Comput.

Existing approaches exhibit a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, with global methods offering higher accuracy but requiring intensive computations, and local methods accelerating the detection at the expense of accuracy. Despite these challenges, few works concentrate on how to effectively handle community detection with imbalanced community scales. To address this gap, first, a hybrid method that combines global and local information in the network is proposed to identify core nodes. This involves incorporating hierarchical structural information used to measure the global influence of the node, together with the effective local boundaries ensuring even distribution of core nodes in the network, to alleviate the impact of community scale imbalance. Second, we propose a two-phase expansion strategy to handle the imbalance scale of communities and prevent over-expansion of a single structure. In the first phase of the strategy, the belonging function is proposed to better measure the strength of connections between the current node and the other nodes for local community expansion. In the second phase of the strategy, we present a weighted label propagation method to efficiently expand the unlabeled boundary nodes and the nodes with overlapping attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted over twenty networks in comparison with eight state-of-the-art baseline methods, demonstrating that CONTEX is very competitive to these methods in achieving higher accuracy of community detection, while maintaining a relevantly lower computational time.","[Liu, Shiliang; Zhang, Xinyao; Ma, Yinglong] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Control & Comp Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Ma, YL (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Control & Comp Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shiliangliu@ncepu.edu.cn; zhangxinyao@ncepu.edu.cn; yinglongma@ncepu.edu.cn,,,,,,,48,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

We propose a community detection method based on the search for the local maxima of an objective function. This objective function reflects the quality of candidate communities in the network structure. The objective function can be constructed from a probability matrix that describes interactions in a network. Different models, such as network structure models and network flow models, can be used to build the probability matrix, and it acts as a link between network models and community detection models. In our influence-spreading model, the probability matrix is called an influence-spreading matrix, which describes the directed influence between all pairs of nodes in the network. By using the local maxima of an objective function, our method can standardise and help in comparing different definitions and approaches of community detection. Our proposed approach can detect overlapping and hierarchical communities and their building blocks within a network. To compare different structures in the network, we define a cohesion measure. The objective function can be expressed as a sum of these cohesion measures. We also discuss the probability of community formation to analyse a different aspect of group behaviour in a network. It is essential to recognise that this concept is separate from the notion of community cohesion, which emphasises the need for varying objective functions in different applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that normalising objective functions by the size of detected communities can alter their rankings.","[Kuikka, Vesa] Finnish Def Res Agcy, Tykkikentantie 1,POB 10, Riihimaki 11311, Finland",,"Kuikka, V (corresponding author), Finnish Def Res Agcy, Tykkikentantie 1,POB 10, Riihimaki 11311, Finland.",vesa.kuikka@aalto.fi,"Kuikka, Vesa/ADZ-0283-2022","Kuikka, Vesa/0000-0002-3677-816X",,,,,64,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-3197,,COMPUTATION,Computation,APR,2024,12.0,4,,,,,,,85,10.3390/computation12040085,0.0,,,35,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Mathematics,OW8D2,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001210396600001,0

Many methods were proposed to identify community structure. Each community identification algorithm has strengths and weaknesses due to the complexity of information. Among them, the optimisation methods are widely focused on. This paper focuses on an empirical study of two community detection algorithms based on agglomerative techniques using modularity metric: Louvain and Leiden. In this regard, the Louvain algorithm has been shown to produce a bad connection in the community and disconnected when executed iteratively. Therefore, the Leiden algorithm is designed to successively resolve the weaknesses. Performance comparisons between the two and their concept were summarised in detail, as well as the step-by-step learning process of the state-of-the-art algorithms. This study is important and beneficial to the future study of interdisciplinary data sciences of network analysis.

The Product Space, a graph representing industrial knowledge proximity, acts as a valuable tool for recommending diversified product offerings. These recommendations rely on the edges of the graph to identify suitable products. They can be improved by grouping similar products together, which results in more precise suggestions. Unlike the topology, the textual data in nodes of the Product Space graph are typically unutilized in graph clustering methods. In this context, we propose a novel approach for economic graph learning that incorporates learning node data alongside network topology. By applying this method to the Product Space dataset, we demonstrate how recommendations have been improved by presenting real-life applications. Our research employing a graph neural network demonstrates superior performance compared to methods like Louvain and I-Louvain. Our contribution introduces a node data-based deep graph clustering graph neural network that significantly advances the macroeconomic literature and addresses the imperative of diversifying industrial production.

These attacks leave clues behind in multiple logs. Systems usually upload their local syslogs as encrypted files to the cloud for longterm storage and resource saving. Therefore, the identification of pre-attack steps through log investigation is crucial for proactive system protection. Current methodologies involve system diagnosis using logs, often relying on datasets for feature training. Furthermore, the prevalence of mass encrypted logs in the cloud introduces a new layer of complexity to this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CrptAC, a system for Multiple Encrypted Log Correlated Analysis, aimed at reconstructing attack chains to prevent further attacks securely. CrptAC initiates by searching and downloading relevant log files from encrypted logs stored in an untrusted cloud environment. Utilizing the obtained logs, it addresses the challenge of discovering event relationships to establish the attack provenance. The system employs various logs to construct event sequences leading up to an attack. Subsequently, we utilize Weighted Graphs and the Longest Common Subsequences algorithm to identify regular steps preceding an attack without the need for third-party training datasets. This approach enables the proactive identification of pre-attack steps by analyzing related log sequences. We apply our methodology to predict attacks in cloud computing and router breach provenance environments. Finally, we validate the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing attack steps and conclusively identifying corresponding syslogs.","[Lin, Weiguo; Ma, Jianfeng; Li, Teng; Ye, Haoyu; Zhang, Jiawei] Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yongcai] State Grid Jiangxi Elect Power Res Inst, Nanchang 330077, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Li, T (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.",tengli@xidian.edu.cn,"ye, haoyu/HNI-5309-2023",,National Key Research and Development Program of China,National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),No Statement Available,,42,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,APR,2024,13.0,7,,,,,,,1378,10.3390/electronics13071378,0.0,,,23,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,NM5Y6,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001200895100001,0

These host-microbiome interactions may spatially vary along the physical and chemical environment of the intestine, but these changes remain unknown. This study investigated these intricate relationships through a gene co-expression network analysis based on dual transcriptome profiling of different intestinal sites-cecum, transverse colon, and rectum-of the primate common marmoset. We proposed a gene module extraction algorithm based on the graph theory to find tightly interacting gene modules of the host and the microbiome from a vast co-expression network. The 27 gene modules identified by this method, which include both host and microbiome genes, not only produced results consistent with previous studies regarding the host-microbiome relationships, but also provided new insights into microbiome genes acting as potential mediators in host-microbiome interplays. Specifically, we discovered associations between the host gene FBP1, a cancer marker, and polysaccharide degradation-related genes (pfkA and fucI) coded by Bacteroides vulgatus, as well as relationships between host B cell-specific genes (CD19, CD22, CD79B, and PTPN6) and a tryptophan synthesis gene (trpB) coded by Parabacteroides distasonis. Furthermore, our proposed module extraction algorithm surpassed existing approaches by successfully defining more functionally related gene modules, providing insights for understanding the complex relationship between the host and the microbiome. IMPORTANCE We unveiled the intricate dynamics of the host-microbiome interactions along the colon by identifying closely interacting gene modules from a vast gene co-expression network, constructed based on simultaneous profiling of both host and microbiome transcriptomes. Our proposed gene module extraction algorithm, designed to interpret inter-species interactions, enabled the identification of functionally related gene modules encompassing both host and microbiome genes, which was challenging with conventional modularity maximization algorithms.

Currently, there is no clear standard or systematic approach for selecting the most appropriate community detection method. Furthermore, the impact of method choice on the accuracy and robustness of estimated communities (and network modularity), as well as method-dependent relationships between network communities and cognitive and other individual measures, are not well understood. This study analyzed large datasets of real brain networks (estimated from resting-state fMRI from n$$ n $$ = 5251 pre/early adolescents in the adolescent brain cognitive development [ABCD] study), and n$$ n $$ = 5338 synthetic networks with heterogeneous, data-inspired topologies, with the goal to investigate and compare three classes of community detection methods: (i) modularity maximization-based (Newman and Louvain), (ii) probabilistic (Bayesian inference within the framework of stochastic block modeling (SBM)), and (iii) geometric (based on graph Ricci flow). Extensive comparisons between methods and their individual accuracy (relative to the ground truth in synthetic networks), and reliability (when applied to multiple fMRI runs from the same brains) suggest that the underlying brain network topology plays a critical role in the accuracy, reliability and agreement of community detection methods. Consistent method (dis)similarities, and their correlations with topological properties, were estimated across fMRI runs. Based on synthetic graphs, most methods performed similarly and had comparable high accuracy only in some topological regimes, specifically those corresponding to developed connectomes with at least quasi-optimal community organization. In contrast, in densely and/or weakly connected networks with difficult to detect communities, the methods yielded highly dissimilar results, with Bayesian inference within SBM having significantly higher accuracy compared to all others. Associations between method-specific modularity and demographic, anthropometric, physiological and cognitive parameters showed mostly method invariance but some method dependence as well. Although method sensitivity to different levels of community structure may in part explain method-dependent associations between modularity estimates and parameters of interest, method dependence also highlights potential issues of reliability and reproducibility. These findings suggest that a probabilistic approach, such as Bayesian inference in the framework of SBM, may provide consistently reliable estimates of community structure across network topologies. In addition, to maximize robustness of biological inferences, identified network communities and their cognitive, behavioral and other correlates should be confirmed with multiple reliable detection methods. Network communities are a fundamental characteristic of human brain's circuit organization. Community detection methods are differentially sensitive to the connectome topology and can yield highly dissimilar estimates, especially in underdeveloped brains, leading to method-dependent mappings to cognitive and other parameters. A probabilistic approach may be more robust than modularity-maximization and geometric methods. image","[Brooks, Skylar J.; Golding, Staunton G.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method for predicting commuting O -D demand matrices. Our method employs community detection algorithms on road networks to precisely partition commute O -D regions, incorporating Points of Interest (POIs). We also present a spatio-temporal dynamic weighted hypergraph model that leverages these partitioned regions, time characteristics from observed O -D trips, and meteorological data to improve forecasting. Comparative analyses with contemporary models and ablation studies indicate our method significantly enhances prediction accuracy, by approximately 5%.

Neighborhood density between nodes is one of the fundamental indicators of community presence in the network. A community with a high edge density will have correlations between nodes that extend beyond their immediate neighbors, denoted by motifs. Motifs are repetitive patterns of edges observed with high frequency in the network. We proposed the PCDMS method (Probabilistic Community Detection with Motif Structure) that detects communities by estimating the triangular motif in the network. This study employs structural density between nodes, a key concept in graph analysis. The proposed model has the advantage of using a probabilistic generative model that calculates the latent parameters of the probabilistic model and determines the community based on the likelihood of triangular motifs. The relationship between observing two pairs of nodes in multiple communities leads to an increasing likelihood estimation of the existence of a motif structure between them. The output of the proposed model is the intensity of each node in the communities. The efficiency and validity of the proposed method are evaluated through experimental work on both synthetic and real-world networks; the findings will show that the community identified by the proposed method is more accurate and dense than other algorithms with modularity, NMI, and F1score evaluation metrics.","[Hajibabaei, Hossein; Seydi, Vahid; Koochari, Abbas] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Seydi, Vahid] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Wales",Islamic Azad University; Bangor University,"Seydi, V (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.;Seydi, V (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Wales.",h.hajibabaei@srbiau.ac.ir; V.seydi@bangor.ac.uk; koochari@srbiau.ac.ir,"Seydi, Vahid/KHZ-7414-2024",,,,,,54,0,0,10,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9902,1573-7675,,J INTELL INF SYST,J.

In recent years, the discovery and characterization of protein complexes have substantially progressed through advances in cryo-electron microscopy, proteomics, and computational structure prediction. This development results in a strong need for computational approaches to analyse the data of large protein complexes for structural and functional characterization. Here, we aim to provide a suitable approach, which processes the growing number of large protein complexes, to obtain biologically meaningful information on the hierarchical organization of the structures of protein complexes.Results We modelled the quaternary structure of protein complexes as undirected, labelled graphs called complex graphs. In complex graphs, the vertices represent protein chains and the edges spatial chain-chain contacts. We hypothesized that clusters based on the complex graph correspond to functional biological modules. To compute the clusters, we applied the Leiden clustering algorithm. To evaluate our approach, we chose the human respiratory complex I, which has been extensively investigated and exhibits a known biological module structure experimentally validated. Additionally, we characterized a eukaryotic group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the head of the bacteriophage phi 29. The analysis of the protein complexes correlated with experimental findings and indicated known functional, biological modules. Using our approach enables not only to predict functional biological modules in large protein complexes with characteristic features but also to investigate the flexibility of specific regions and coformational changes. The predicted modules can aid in the planning and analysis of experiments.Availability and implementation Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the examples are available on our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/MolBIFFM/PTGLtools/tree/main/PTGLmodulePrediction.","[Gisdon, Florian J.; Zunker, Mariella; Wolf, Jan Niclas; Pruefer, Kai; Ackermann, Joerg; Koch, Ina] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Comp Sci & Math, Inst Comp Sci, Mol Bioinformat, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Welsch, Christoph] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Univ Hosp, Med Clin 1, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt Hospital,"Gisdon, FJ; Koch, I (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Comp Sci & Math, Inst Comp Sci, Mol Bioinformat, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",florian.gisdon@bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de; ina.koch@bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Gisdon, Florian J./0000-0002-3432-5992","Consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative); ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); Goethe University Frankfurt; Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","Consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative); ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); Goethe University Frankfurt; Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","This work was supported by the consortia ACLF-I (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure-Initiative) and ENABLE (Unraveling mechanisms driving cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and infection to enable new approaches in translational medicine) (Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts); and Goethe University Frankfurt and the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts (providing financial and infrastructural support).

However, the existing clustering techniques often struggle to provide timely and accurate cell type groupings when dealing with datasets with large-scale or imbalanced cell types. Therefore, there is a need for improved methods that can handle the increasing size of scRNA-seq datasets while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency. Methods We propose CDSKNNXMBD (Community Detection based on a Stable K-Nearest Neighbor Graph Structure), a novel single-cell clustering framework integrating partition clustering algorithm and community detection algorithm, which achieves accurate and fast cell type grouping by finding a stable graph structure. Results We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing 15 tissues from the human fetal atlas. Compared to existing methods, CDSKNN effectively counteracts the high imbalance in single-cell data, enabling effective clustering. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons across multiple single-cell datasets from different studies and sequencing techniques. CDSKNN is of high applicability and robustness, and capable of balancing the complexities of across diverse types of data. Most importantly, CDSKNN exhibits higher operational efficiency on datasets at the million-cell scale, requiring an average of only 6.33 min for clustering 1.46 million single cells, saving 33.3% to 99% of running time compared to those of existing methods. Conclusions The CDSKNN is a flexible, resilient, and promising clustering tool that is particularly suitable for clustering imbalanced data and demonstrates high efficiency on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.","[Ren, Jun; Shi, Xiaodong] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361105, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hematol, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Inst Hematol, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Lyu, Xuejing; Guo, Jintao; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Natl Inst Data Sci Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hematol, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Inst Hematol, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Natl Inst Data Sci Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.",yingzhou@xmu.edu.cn; qiyuan.li@xmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),None.,,43,0,0,7,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1479-5876,,J TRANSL MED,J.

Document clustering is vital in areas like information retrieval, knowledge management, and marketing, underscoring the need for a highly accurate clustering model. Current models in document clustering face significant hurdles, such as dealing with sparse, high -dimensional representations based on the bag -of -words (BOW) approach, which are not only computationally demanding on large datasets but also lack in capturing the semantic nuances of documents. Additionally, these models struggle with determining the ideal number of clusters and managing datasets with overlapping elements. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel co -clustering strategy that merges community detection methods from social network analysis with advanced text analysis techniques. The proposed method transforms documents into a network structure, where each document is a node and connections (edges) are formed between documents that are most similar. Community detection algorithms are then employed to identify clusters within this network of documents. The study explores various document representation methods, including topic modelling and sentence embedding, to provide a rich contextual understanding of the documents. An extensive evaluation is carried out, examining different combinations of community detection algorithms, clustering methodologies, and document representation strategies, particularly focusing on their efficacy in handling overlapping and non -overlapping datasets. The findings demonstrate that the Element -Centric evaluation measure is effective in enabling community detection algorithms to autonomously ascertain the most suitable number of clusters, yielding promising results for both overlapping and non -overlapping datasets. The LCD model shows remarkable performance in addressing overlapping datasets. Furthermore, the research reveals that innovative document representation approaches significantly enhance the performance of the models. Additionally, the use of topic modelling in conjunction with co -clustering algorithms proves effective in clearly depicting the themes within the clusters.","[Amiri, Babak; Karimianghadim, Ramin] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Amiri, B (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran.",babakamiri@iust.ac.ir,,,,,,,87,1,1,1,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0960-0779,1873-2887,,CHAOS SOLITON FRACT,Chaos Solitons Fractals,APR,2024,181.0,,,,,,,,114633,10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114633,0.0,,MAR 2024,12,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Mathematical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Physics,NW3L8,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001203452300001,0

This approach leverages ground-truth or estimated vertex labels, enabling an efficient embedding of large-scale graph data and the processing of billions of edges within minutes. Furthermore, this embedding unveils a temporal dynamic statistic capable of detecting communication pattern shifts across all levels, ranging from individual vertices to vertex communities and the overall graph structure. We provide theoretical support to confirm its soundness under random graph models, and demonstrate its numerical advantages in capturing evolving communities and identifying outliers.

Mice homozygous for this allele (PEP-619WW) clear the LCMV-cl13 virus whereas wildtype (PEP-WT) mice cannot.

Those CSAs have discrete boundaries and may not capture the increasingly interwoven cancer care markets. This is the first attempt to delineate possible overlapping CSAs. Specifically, we integrate the concept of shared memberships and other spatial attributes into the Speaker-Listener Label Propagation (SLPA) algorithm, termed the spatially constrained SLPA (or ScSLPA), and apply it to six representative areas in the U.S. The results show that overlapping CSAs tend to form in areas that are more urbanized, with higher localization index (LI) values, larger populations, and shorter travel times than discrete CSAs. Two CSAs in Los Angeles and San Diego are consistent with the catchment areas (CAs) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers, and other CSAs are much smaller than the CAs of their anchoring cancer centers. The study has important implications for public health policy to advance cancer control and prevention efforts.","[Wang, Changzhen] Univ Alabama, Dept Geog & Environm, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Pinkie Gordon Lane Grad Sch, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Pinkie Gordon Lane Grad Sch, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Pinkie Gordon Lane Grad Sch, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,,"Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024",National Cancer Institute; National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R21CA212687]; National Institutes of Health,National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Cancer Institute (NCI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"Financial support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health, under Grant R21CA212687, is gratefully acknowledged.

BANKSY's spatial feature augmentation strategy improved performance on both tasks when tested on diverse RNA (imaging, sequencing) and protein (imaging) datasets. BANKSY revealed unexpected niche-dependent cell states in the mouse brain and outperformed competing methods on domain segmentation and cell typing benchmarks. BANKSY can also be used for quality control of spatial transcriptomics data and for spatially aware batch effect correction. Importantly, it is substantially faster and more scalable than existing methods, enabling the processing of millions of cell datasets. In summary, BANKSY provides an accurate, biologically motivated, scalable and versatile framework for analyzing spatially resolved omics data. BANKSY is an algorithm with R and Python implementations that identifies both cell types and tissue domains from spatially resolved omics data by incorporating spatial kernels capturing microenvironmental information.

Controlling cascade failures on power grids is important for many reasons like economic impact, national security, public safety and even rippled effects like troubling transportation systems. Monitoring the networks on node level has been suggested by many, either controlling all nodes of a network or by subsets. This study identifies sensitive graph elements of the weighted European power-grids (from 2016 and 2022) by two different methods. Bridges are determined between communities and weak nodes are selected by the lowest local synchronization of the swing equation. In the latter case we add bypasses of the same number as the bridges at weak nodes, and we compare the synchronization, cascade failure behavior by the dynamical improvement with the purely topological changes. The results are also compared if bridges are removed from networks, which results in a case similar to islanding, and with the addition of links at randomly selected places. Bypassing was found to improve synchronization the best, while the average cascade sizes are the lowest with bridge additions. However, for very large or small global couplings these network changes do not help, they seem to be useful near the synchronization transition region, where self-organization drives the power grid. Thus, we provide a demonstration for the Braess' Paradox on continent-sized power-grid simulations and uncover the limitations of this phenomenon. We also determine the cascade size distributions and justify the power-law tails near the transition point on these grids.","[Odor, Geza; Papp, Istvan] HAS Ctr Energy Res, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Papp, Istvan] Wigner Res Ctr Phys, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Benedek, Kristof] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Muegyetem Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Hartmann, Balint] Inst Energy Secur & Environm Safety, Ctr Energy Res, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Energy Research; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Energy Research,"Odor, G (corresponding author), HAS Ctr Energy Res, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary.",odor@mfa.kfki.hu; hartmann.balint@ek.hun-ren.hu,,"Papp, Istvan/0000-0001-9711-399X","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH), Hungary [K128989]; Eotvos Lorand Kutatoi Halozat (ELKH) [SA-44/2021]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH), Hungary(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Eotvos Lorand Kutatoi Halozat (ELKH)","Support from the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH), Hungary (Grant No. K128989) and from the Eotvos Lorand Kutatoi Halozat (ELKH) Grant No. SA-44/2021 is acknowledged.

One key field of research in spatial transcriptomics is the identification of spatial domains, which refers to distinct regions within the tissue where specific gene expression patterns are observed. Diverse methodologies have been proposed, each with its unique characteristics. As the availability of spatial transcriptomics data continues to expand, there is a growing need for methods that can integrate information from multiple slices to discover spatial domains. To extend the applicability of existing single-slice analysis methods to multi-slice clustering, we introduce BiGATAE (Bipartite Graph Attention Auto Encoder) that leverages gene expression information from adjacent tissue slices to enhance spatial transcriptomics data. BiGATAE comprises two steps: aligning slices to generate an adjacency matrix for different spots in consecutive slices and constructing a bipartite graph. Subsequently, it utilizes a graph attention network to integrate information across different slices. Then it can seamlessly integrate with pre-existing techniques. To evaluate the performance of BiGATAE, we conducted benchmarking analyses on three different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that for existing single-slice clustering methods, the integration of BiGATAE significantly enhances their performance. Moreover, single-slice clustering methods integrated with BiGATAE outperform methods specifically designed for multi-slice integration. These results underscore the proficiency of BiGATAE in facilitating information transfer across multiple slices and its capacity to broaden the applicability and sustainability of pre-existing methods.","[Tao, Yuhao; Sun, Xiaoang; Wang, Fei] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Wang, F (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wangfei@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC61472086],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported in part by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC61472086).,,34,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1467-5463,1477-4054,,BRIEF BIOINFORM,Brief.

How to choose the most appropriate method generally depends on the type of network being analysed and the specific properties of the data that define the network. In functional temporal networks derived from neuronal spike train data, communities are expected to be transient, and it is common for the network to contain multiple singleton communities. Here, we compare the performance of different DCD methods on functional temporal networks built from synthetic neuronal time series data with known community structure. We find that, for these networks, DCD methods that utilize interlayer links to perform community carry over between layers outperform other methods. However, we also observe that DCD performance is highly dependent on the topology of interlayer links, especially in the presence of singleton and transient communities. We therefore define a novel way of defining interlayer links in temporal networks called skeleton coupling that is specifically designed to enhance the linkage of communities in the network throughout time based on the topological properties of the community history. We show that integrating skeleton coupling with current DCD methods improves the method's performance in synthetic data with planted singleton and transient communities. The use of skeleton coupling to perform DCD will therefore allow for more accurate and interpretable results of community evolution in real-world neuronal data or in other systems with transient structure and singleton communities.","[Kilic, Bengier Ulgen; Muldoon, Sarah Feldt] Univ Buffalo, SUNY, Dept Math, 244 Math Bldg, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Kilic, Bengier Ulgen] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, 9500 Euclid Ave,ND20, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Muldoon, Sarah Feldt] Univ Buffalo, SUNY, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Data Sci, 215 Lockwood Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Muldoon, Sarah Feldt] Univ Buffalo, Jacobs Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Neurosci Program, SUNY, 955 Main St,Suite 3102, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; SUNY Maritime College; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Maritime College; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; SUNY Maritime College,"Kilic, BU (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo, SUNY, Dept Math, 244 Math Bldg, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.;Kilic, BU (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, 9500 Euclid Ave,ND20, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",bengieru@buffalo.edu,,"Kilic, Bengier Ulgen/0000-0002-4096-8417; Muldoon, Sarah/0000-0002-2830-9291",National Science Foundation [SMA-1734795],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by The National Science Foundation 'SMA-1734795' to S.F.M.,,55,0,0,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1310,2051-1329,,J COMPLEX NETW,J.

Erythropoiesis is hierarchical in that it results from a series of cell fate decisions whereby hematopoietic stem cells progress toward the erythroid lineage. Single -cell transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have revolutionized the way we understand erythropoiesis, revealing it to be a gradual process that underlies a progressive restriction of fate potential driven by quantitative changes in lineage -specifying transcription factors. Despite these major advances, we still know very little about what cell fate decision entails at the molecular level. Novel approaches that simultaneously measure additional properties in single cells, including chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and/or cell surface proteins are being developed at a fast pace, providing the means to exciting new advances in the near future. In this review, we briefly summarize the main findings obtained from single -cell studies of erythropoiesis, highlight outstanding questions, and suggest recent technological advances to address them.

By perusing a thorough report submitted to Bourbon authorities on notarial transactions, which included both ecclesiastical and non-ecclesiastical loans in the city, the article estimates the volume and size of lending activity while exploring how distinct types of credit interacted and shaped the business milieu of the region. It argues that by the late 1770s, Catholic Church lending had ceased to be the main source of investable funds in the region, with merchants and other non-ecclesiastical investors injecting growing funds into sectors traditionally avoided by ecclesiastical lenders such as commerce, mining and manufacturing. Network analysis suggests that merchants became brokers between different credit sources, alleviating information asymmetries and opening the credit market to borrowers with collateral and institutional restrictions willing to pay higher interest rates. Finally, by focusing on New Granada, the largest gold producer of the Spanish Empire, the article identifies some distinctive credit patterns that are different from those developed in silver-driven economies such as New Spain and Peru. Thus, the article provides new paths to study Latin American financial history.","[Granados, Oscar M.] Univ Jorge TadeoLozano, Dept Econ Finance & Commerce, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Torres, James V.] Univ Andes, Dept Hist & Geog, Bogota, DC, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Granados, OM (corresponding author), Univ Jorge TadeoLozano, Dept Econ Finance & Commerce, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",oscarm.granadose@utadeo.edu.co; jv.torres10@uniandes.edu.co,,,,,,,63,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0968-5650,1474-0052,,FINANC HIST REV,Financ.

Experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks show that our algorithm has better stability than the label propagation algorithm and finds communities with small sizes and indistinct boundaries more effectively than most state-of-the-art community detection methods.","[Douadi, Asma; Kamel, Nadjet] Univ Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Dept Comp Sci, LRSD, Setif, Algeria; [Sais, Lakhdar] Univ Artois, CRIL, CNRS, Lens, France",Universite Ferhat Abbas Setif; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite d'Artois,"Douadi, A (corresponding author), Univ Ferhat Abbas Setif 1, Dept Comp Sci, LRSD, Setif, Algeria.",asma.douadi@univ-setif.dz; nkamel@univ-setif.dz; sais@cril.fr,,,,,,,54,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-8542,1573-0484,,J SUPERCOMPUT,J.

However, there is not enough awareness that members of a community C (either revealed or not) inside a network $G$ could act strategically to evade such tools either for legitimate (e.g., activist groups in authoritarian regimes) or malicious (e.g., terrorists) purpose. Community deception offers this possibility. By identifying a certain number of C 's member connections to be rewired, community deception algorithms can successfully hide a community that wants to stay below the radar of detection techniques. However, the state-of-the-art deception approaches have focused on networks without attributes, although real-world networks (e.g., Facebook) include attributes (e.g., age and sex) that play a central role in detecting more accurate communities. This article faces three novel challenges introduced when designing deception techniques for networks with attributes. The first concerns how to model and encode attributes most flexibly. The second is about framing attribute-aware community deception as an optimization problem. Finally, the challenge of solving the optimization problem by leveraging network topology and attributes also arises. We leverage a simple way to model network attributes as edge weights, a novel optimization function called community diffusion, and Diffuser a greedy algorithm to optimize diffusion, to solve the above challenges. We evaluated Diffuser against several community detection algorithms and compared it with state-of-the-art deception approaches on various real-world networks. From the evaluation, we can draw two main observations. First, adopting attribute-oblivious deception techniques leads to unsatisfactory results. Second, community diffusion as an optimization function specific to attributed networks is preferred to community safeness, the state-of-the-art deception optimization function, even when recasting the latter as an attribute-aware function.","[Fionda, Valeria] Univ Calabria, DeMaCS, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Pirro, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ Rome, DI, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Calabria; Sapienza University Rome,"Pirr√≤, G (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, DI, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",fionda@mat.unical.it; pirro@di.uniroma1.it,,"Fionda, Valeria/0000-0002-7018-1324",,,,,31,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Graph convolution network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT), fed with spatial coordinates derived adjacency and transcription profile derived feature matrix are often used to solve the problem. Our proposed method STGIC (spatial transcriptomic clustering with graph and image convolution) is designed for techniques with regular lattices on chips. It utilizes an adaptive graph convolution (AGC) to get high quality pseudo-labels and then resorts to dilated convolution framework (DCF) for virtual image converted from gene expression information and spatial coordinates of spots. The dilation rates and kernel sizes are set appropriately and updating of weight values in the kernels is made to be subject to the spatial distance from the position of corresponding elements to kernel centers so that feature extraction of each spot is better guided by spatial distance to neighbor spots. Self-supervision realized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, spatial continuity loss and cross entropy calculated among spots with high confidence pseudo-labels make up the training objective of DCF. STGIC attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering performance on the benchmark dataset of 10x Visium human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Besides, it's capable of depicting fine structures of other tissues from other species as well as guiding the identification of marker genes. Also, STGIC is expandable to Stereo-seq data with high spatial resolution. Spatial transcriptomics detect gene transcription profile with high spatial resolution even to sub-cellular level, which is very helpful to characterize organization and architecture of tissues and find marker genes corresponding to sub-structures. Therefore, it is much more informative than traditional transcriptomics for interpreting the biological processes underlying tissue development and disease progression. Clustering to clarify each spatial domain of tissues in which cells present similar transcription profile and histology is a primary task for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. To solve the important problem, we propose the method STGIC combining deep learning skills in both graph and image, since we notice that image methods tend to display good performances on some samples in benchmark datasets which existing graph methods are not good at, and vice versa. Besides, we substitute the vanilla form of graph convolution frequently used in this field with the one which can find the optimal order of neighbor involved in feature aggregation adaptively for different graphs. STGIC displays high clustering performance and identifies spatial domains which can be used to depict fine-grained structure and help ascertain marker genes of different tissues from different species sequenced with 10x Visum and Stereo-seq techniques.","[Zhang, Chen; Kong, Lingxin; Ren, Bin; Wei, Dong-Qing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Junhui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong-Yu] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cao, Guangshuo] Guizhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiangyu] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Smart Hlth Initiat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Liu, Wei] Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Guizhou University; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Zhejiang Ocean University,"Wei, DQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",dqwei@sjtu.edu.cn,"Wei, Dongqing/E-6398-2010","Wei, Dongqing/0000-0003-4200-7502; Guo, Xiangyu/0000-0001-5835-490X; Zhang, Chen/0009-0005-8396-9398; Gao, Junhui/0000-0002-5796-2513","National Natural Science Foundation of China [32070662, 61832019, 32030063]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32070662, 61832019, 32030063) received by Dong-Qing Wei.

We start by applying visibility graph theory to process time series data, resulting in a corresponding complex network. Next, we introduce an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with modularity Q as the objective function to optimize community detection. Finally, mapping the communities back to the nodes of the time series yields the segmented sequence. Our proposed method offers high segmentation accuracy and low time complexity (O(n(2))).

The composition of these editorial boards is explored in terms of geographic affiliation, institutional affiliation, and gender. Results highlight that the academic publishing environment is primarily governed by men affiliated with elite universities in the United States. The study further explores social similarities among journals using a network analysis perspective based on interlocking editorship. Comparison of networks generated by all scholars, editorial leaders, and non-editorial leaders reveals significant structural similarities and associations among clusters of journals. These results indicate that links between pairs of journals tend to be redundant, and this can be interpreted in terms of social and intellectual homophily within each board, and between boards of journals belonging to the same cluster. Finally, the analysis of the most central journals and scholars in the networks suggests that journals probably adopt 'strategic decisions' in the selection of the editorial board members.

Here, we present a framework (PROST) for the quantitative recognition of spatial transcriptomic patterns, consisting of (i) quantitatively characterizing spatial variations in gene expression patterns through the PROST Index; and (ii) unsupervised clustering of spatial domains via a self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that PROST performs superior SVG identification and domain segmentation with various spatial resolutions, from multicellular to cellular levels. Importantly, PROST Index can be applied to prioritize spatial expression variations, facilitating the exploration of biological insights. Together, our study provides a flexible and robust framework for analyzing diverse spatial transcriptomic data.

This study employs single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate molecular changes in tumor stroma that influence PCa progression and metastasis. Analyzing mesenchymal cells from four genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and correlating these findings with human tumors, we identify eight stromal cell populations with distinct transcriptional identities consistent across both species. Notably, stromal signatures in advanced mouse disease reflect those in human bone metastases, highlighting periostin's role in invasion and differentiation. From these insights, we derive a gene signature that predicts metastatic progression in localized disease beyond traditional Gleason scores.

However, due to the high noise and heterogeneity of the single-cell data, it is challenging to infer cell trajectory in complex biological processes. Here, we proposed a new trajectory inference method, called Metric Learning Bhattacharyya Kernel Feature Decomposition (MLBKFD). In MLBKFD, a statistical model was used to infer cell trajectory by calculating the Markov transition matrix and Bhattacharyya kernel matrix between cells. Before that, to expedite the matrix calculation in the statistical model, a deep feedforward neural network was used to perform dimensionality reduction on single-cell data. The MLBKFD was evaluated on four typical datasets as well as seven recent human fetal lung datasets. Comparisons with the two outstanding methods (i.e., DTFLOW and MARGARET) demonstrate that the MLBKFD is capable of accurately inferring cell development and differentiation trajectories from single-cell data with different sizes and sources. Notably, MLBKFD exhibits nearly twice the speed of DTFLOW while maintaining high precision, particularly when dealing with large datasets. MLBKFD provides accurate and efficient trajectory inference, empowering researchers to gain deeper insights into the complex dynamics of cell development and differentiation.","[Han, Changfeng; Li, Cheng; Wang, Yuebin; Shi, Ya-Zhou; Zhang, Ben-Gong] Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wenjie] Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Math, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanbing] Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, P, R China, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China",Wuhan Textile University; Sun Yat Sen University; Wuhan Textile University,"Zhang, BG (corresponding author), Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China.",bgzhang@wtu.edu.cn,,"Guo, Yanbing/0009-0001-8147-1853; wang, yue bin/0009-0004-3756-7390; Zhang, Ben-gong/0000-0002-2766-6502; Li, Cheng/0009-0008-3882-7069; cao, wen jie/0009-0002-7112-1013; Shi, Ya-Zhou/0000-0003-2579-3134; Han, Changfeng/0009-0002-5266-8101","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11971367, 12371500]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant numbers 11971367, 12371500].",,73,2,2,6,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2737-4165,2737-4173,,J COMPUT BIOPHYS CHE,J.

However, due to their species-specific nature, conventional reference-based annotation tools often underestimate the true number of sensory receptors in a given species. While there has been an exponential increase in the taxonomic diversity of publicly available genome assemblies in recent years, only similar to 30% of vertebrate species on the NCBI database are currently annotated. To overcome these limitations, we developed 'Sensommatic', an automated and accessible sensory receptor annotation pipeline. Sensommatic implements BLAST and AUGUSTUS to mine and predict sensory receptor genes from whole genome assemblies, adopting a one-to-many gene mapping approach. While designed for vertebrates, Sensommatic can be extended to run on non-vertebrate species by generating customized reference files, making it a scalable and generalizable tool.

There are many available methods to perform pathway analysis, many of them rely on an upstream differential expression analysis, and many model the relations between the abundances of the analytes in a pathway as linear relationships.Results Here, we propose a new method for pathway analysis, MIPath, that relies on information theoretical principles and, therefore, does not model the association between pathway activity and phenotype, resulting in relatively few assumptions. For this, we construct a graph of the data points for each pathway using a nearest-neighbor approach and score the association between the structure of this graph and the phenotype of these same samples using Mutual Information while adjusting for the effects of random chance in each score. The initial nearest neighbor approach evades individual gene-level comparisons, hence making the method scalable and less vulnerable to missing values. These properties make our method particularly useful for single-cell data. We benchmarked our method on several single-cell datasets, comparing it to established and new methods, and found that it produces robust, reproducible, and meaningful scores.Availability and implementation Source code is available at https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/mipath, or through Python Package Index as mipathway.","[Jeuken, Gustavo S.; Kall, Lukas] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, Tomtebodavagen 23, S-17165 Stockholm, Sweden; [Jeuken, Gustavo S.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Comp Sci Dept, De Boelelaan 1111, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Jeuken, GS; K√§ll, L (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, Tomtebodavagen 23, S-17165 Stockholm, Sweden.;Jeuken, GS (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Comp Sci Dept, De Boelelaan 1111, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",g.stolfjeuken@vu.nl; lukas.kall@scilifelab.se,"; Kall, Lukas/A-7334-2009","S.

Investigating scholars' topic switching behavior quantitatively is essential for understanding the driving forces behind technological development in CS. However, the continuous growth of scientific publications poses challenges in accurately tracking scholars' topic switching. To address this, this study utilizes a large-scale dataset from the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) to construct bibliographic coupling networks for 16,794 scholars, enabling the detection of their research topics using the Louvain algorithm. Subsequently, this study introduces a novel two-dimensional metric to quantify scholars' topic switching behavior: topic switching degree and topic switching probability. This metric enables the classification of scholars into four distinct types: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Our analysis reveals that the majority of scholars belong to Type B, characterized by high topic switching probability but low degree, correlating with the highest quantity, quality, and citations of publications. Scholars categorized as Type A and Type D follow, while those falling under Type C, indicating low topic switching probability but high degree, tend to have the lowest publications and citations. Employing these new two-dimensional indicators to measure scholars' topic switching behavior and exploring its relationship with research performance contribute to advancements in technology within the field of computer science.","[Yin, Dehu] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Yin, DH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",1019209055@tju.edu.cn,,,The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program [20220615ZZ07110404],The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program,This work was supported by the 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program under Grant 20220615ZZ07110404.,,52,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,,104263,104271,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434546,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,C0V8F,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001286635200001,0

Thus, we propose a frequent closed high-utility itemset mining (FCHUIM) algorithm based on Leiden community detection and a compact genetic algorithm (LcGA). This algorithm first employs Leiden community detection to decompose a dataset into several highly related transaction communities and then uses an approximate or exact strategy to mine frequent itemsets. Subsequently, it checks for closures in the mined frequent itemsets and finally employs the compact genetic algorithm to efficiently mine high-utility patterns from the frequent closed itemsets. Experimental results on four real datasets, namely Retail, Chainstore, Chess, Accidents,among which the datatype of the former two is Sparse and that of the latter two is Dense, demonstrate that compared with modified traditional closed high-utility mining algorithms, including CHUI-Miner-S, CLS-Miner-S and the most advanced algorithms for mining frequent closed high-utility mining algorithms called FCHUIM, the average runtime of LcGA-FCHUIM is lower by 40.5% than the optimal contrastive algorithm.

Nevertheless, the high dimensionality and intricate nature of cell heterogeneity have presented substantial challenges to computational methods. Numerous novel clustering methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, none of these methods achieve the consistently better performance under different biological scenarios. In this study, we developed CAKE, a novel and scalable self-supervised clustering method, which consists of a contrastive learning model with a mixture neighborhood augmentation for cell representation learning, and a self-Knowledge Distiller model for the refinement of clustering results. These designs provide more condensed and cluster-friendly cell representations and improve the clustering performance in term of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, in addition to accurately identifying the major type cells, CAKE could also find more biologically meaningful cell subgroups and rare cell types. The comprehensive experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrated the superiority of CAKE in visualization and clustering over other comparison methods, and indicated its extensive application in the field of cell heterogeneity analysis.

Indeed, nDec considers how nodes can be moved between communities and analyzes the most profitable C's node removals and additions. nDec is built around a node-centric view optimization function based on modularity, a well-known cluster quality metric. We discovered that rather than blindly minimizing modularityas edge-centric approaches do, it is possible to devise a strategy appealing to detection algorithms while improving the level of concealment of C.

It is classified as an NP-class problem, and several algorithms have been proposed with specific objectives. There also exist various quality metrics for evaluating them. Having clusters with the required density can be beneficial because it permits the effective deployment of resources. This study proposes an approach to partitioning and overlapping clustering of undirected unweighted graphs, allowing users to specify the required density of resultant clusters. This required density is achieved by means of 'Relative Density'. The proposed algorithm adopts an edge-based approach, commencing with the determination of the edge degree for each edge. The main clustering process is then initiated by an edge with an average degree. A cluster is expanded by considering adjacent edges that can be included while monitoring the relative density of the cluster. Eight empirical networks with diverse characteristics are used to validate the proposed algorithm for both partitioning and overlapping clustering. Their results are assessed using an appropriate metric known as the mean relative density deviation coefficient (MRDDC). This is the first work that attempts to carry out partitioning and overlapping graph clustering, which allows user-specified density.","[Tariq, Rohi; Lavangnananda, Kittichai; Mongkolnam, Pornchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Bouvry, Pascal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp Sci, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of Luxembourg,"Tariq, R; Lavangnananda, K (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",rohi.tariq@mail.kmutt.ac.th; kittichai.lav@gmail.com; pascal.bouvry@uni.lu; pornchai.mon@kmutt.ac.th,,"Mongkolnam, Pornchai/0000-0001-6069-1315","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg",No Statement Available,,72,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The identification and characterization of cellular heterogeneity are typically achieved through unsupervised clustering, which crucially relies on a similarity metric. Results: We here propose the use of Optimal Transport (OT) as a cell-cell similarity metric for single-cell omics data. OT defines distances to compare high-dimensional data represented as probability distributions. To speed up computations and cope with the high dimensionality of single-cell data, we consider the entropic regularization of the classical OT distance. We then extensively benchmark OT against state-of-the-art metrics over 13 independent datasets, including simulated, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. First, we test the ability of the metrics to detect the similarity between cells belonging to the same groups (e.g. cell types, cell lines of origin). Then, we apply unsupervised clustering and test the quality of the resulting clusters. OT is found to improve cell-cell similarity inference and cell clustering in all simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as well as in scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data.","[Huizing, Geert-Jan; Cantini, Laura] Univ PSL, Inst Biol, Ecole Normale Super, INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Huizing, Geert-Jan; Peyre, Gabriel] Univ PSL, Dept Math & Applicat, Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Huizing, GJ; Cantini, L (corresponding author), Univ PSL, Inst Biol, Ecole Normale Super, INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France.;Huizing, GJ (corresponding author), Univ PSL, Dept Math & Applicat, Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France.",huizing@ens.fr; laura.cantini@ens.fr,"Cantini, Laura/U-4810-2017; Peyr√©, Gabriel/P-2438-2015","Cantini, Laura/0000-0001-6360-4440; Huizing, Geert-Jan/0000-0001-5208-7855",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); GENCI-IDRIS [2021-AD011012285]; European Research Council (ERC project NORIA); French government [ANR19-P3IA-0001],Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); GENCI-IDRIS; European Research Council (ERC project NORIA)(European Research Council (ERC)); French government,"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)JCJC project scMOmix and Sanofi iTech Awards.

Data reveal a flexible motif in the MKK1 docking domain that promotes efficient activation of ERK2, and suggest epistasis between the residues within that sequence. The combination of ultrahigh-throughput screening and sequencing informs on function and intragenic epistasis within combinatorial protein mutant libraries. Establishing a droplet-based, in vitro compartmentalised approach for robust expression and screening of protein kinase cascades (>10(7) variants/day) allowed us to dissect the intrinsic molecular features of the MKK-ERK signalling pathway, without interference from endogenous cellular components. In a six-residue combinatorial library of the MKK1 docking domain, we identified 29,563 sequence permutations that allow MKK1 to efficiently phosphorylate and activate its downstream target kinase ERK2. A flexibly placed hydrophobic sequence motif emerges which is defined by higher order epistatic interactions between six residues, suggesting synergy that enables high connectivity in the sequence landscape. Through positive epistasis, MKK1 maintains function during mutagenesis, establishing the importance of co-dependent residues in mammalian protein kinase-substrate interactions, and creating a scenario for the evolution of diverse human signalling networks.","[Scheele, Remkes A.; Lindenburg, Laurens H.; Petek, Maya; Schober, Markus; Hollfelder, Florian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Petek, Maya] Univ Maribor, Fac Med, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Dalby, Kevin N.] Univ Texas Austin, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Cambridge; University of Maribor; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hollfelder, F (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",fh111@cam.ac.uk,"Petek, Maya/ABF-3556-2021; Lindenburg, Laurens/J-5433-2014","Petek, Maya/0000-0002-4597-4162; Scheele, Remkes/0000-0002-5354-8286; Lindenburg, Laurens/0000-0001-6775-8041; Hollfelder, Florian/0000-0002-1367-6312",Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission; individual postdoctoral EU Marie-Curie fellowships; EU ITN MMBIO; ERC [695669]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M011194/1]; Welch Foundation [F-1390]; European Research Council (ERC) [695669] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission(Horizon 2020); individual postdoctoral EU Marie-Curie fellowships(European Union (EU)); EU ITN MMBIO; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Welch Foundation(The Welch Foundation); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Esther Perez of the Cambridge NIHR BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub, the late Nigel Miller and Joana Cerveira of the Department of Pathology for help with flow cytometric analysis.

Various scRNA-seq data clustering algorithms have been specifically designed to automatically estimate the number of cell types through optimising the number of clusters in a dataset. The lack of benchmark studies, however, complicates the choice of the methods. Results: We systematically benchmark a range of popular clustering algorithms on estimating the number of cell types in a variety of settings by sampling from the Tabula Muris data to create scRNA-seq datasets with a varying number of cell types, varying number of cells in each cell type, and different cell type proportions. The large number of datasets enables us to assess the performance of the algorithms, covering four broad categories of approaches, from various aspects using a panel of criteria. We further cross-compared the performance on datasets with high cell numbers using Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens data. Conclusions: We identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method on multiple criteria including the deviation of estimation from the true number of cell types, variability of estimation, clustering concordance of cells to their predefined cell types, and running time and peak memory usage. We then summarise these results into a multi-aspect recommendation to the users.

Here, we revisit Leonard Hayflick's original observation of replicative senescence in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts equipped with a battery of modern techniques including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq. We find evidence that the transition to a senescent state manifests early, increases gradually, and corresponds to a concomitant global increase in DNA accessibility in nucleolar and lamin associated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that senescent WI-38 cells acquire a striking resemblance to myofibroblasts in a process similar to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by t YAP1/TEAD1 and TGF-beta 2.

This study uses cancer care as an example to illustrate the methodology, with the nine-state Northeast Region of the USA as the study area. Two recent algorithms of network community detection are implemented to account for additional constraints such as spatial connectivity and threshold region size. The refined methods are termed spatially constrained Louvain (ScLouvain) and spatially constrained Leiden (ScLeiden) algorithms, corresponding to their predecessors the Louvain and Leiden algorithms, respectively. Both are network optimization methods that maximize flows within delineated communities while minimizing inter-community flows. The service areas derived by the methods, termed cancer service areas, are more favorable than the commonly used comparable unit, hospital referral regions, for evaluating cancer-specific variations in care. Between the two, the ScLeiden performs better than the ScLouvain in terms of modularity, localization index and computational efficiency, and thus is recommended as an effective and efficient approach for defining functional regions.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,"Wang, Fahui/H-4302-2013; Wang, Fahui/AAF-4700-2022","Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024; Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024; Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",National Cancer Institute (US) [R21CA212687],National Cancer Institute (US)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"National Cancer Institute (US), Grant/Award Number: R21CA212687",,27,20,24,6,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-1682,1467-9671,,T GIS,Trans.

Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets. Results: We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable time frames. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST.","[Abdelaal, Tamim; Lelieveldt, Boudewijn P.

While the differential expression of Hox genes shifts from the anterior-posterior (A-P) to the proximal-distal (P-D) axis around embryonic day 11 (E11), whether this shift coincides with a more global change of A-P to P-D patterning program remains unclear. By performing and analyzing the transcriptome of the developing limb bud from E10.5 to E12.5, at single-cell resolution, we have uncovered transcriptional trajectories that revealed a general switch from A-P to P-D genetic program between E10.5 and E11.5. Interestingly, all the transcriptional trajectories at E10.5 end with cells expressing either proximal or distal markers suggesting a progressive acquisition of P-D identity. Moreover, we identified three categories of genes expressed in the distal limb mesenchyme characterized by distinct temporal expression dynamics. Among these are Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 (Hox13 hereafter), which start to be expressed around E10.5, and importantly the binding of the HOX13 factors was observed within or in the neighborhood of several of the distal limb genes. Our data are consistent with previous evidence suggesting that the transition from the early/proximal to the late/distal transcriptome of the limb mesenchyme largely relies on HOX13 function. Based on these results and the evidence that HOX13 factors restrict Hoxa11 expression to the proximal limb, in progenitor cells of the zeugopod, we propose that HOX13 act as a key determinant of P-D patterning.","[Desanlis, Ines; Paul, Rachel; Kmita, Marie] Inst Rech Clin Montreal, Genet & Dev Res Unit, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada; [Desanlis, Ines; Kmita, Marie] Univ Montreal, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Paul, Rachel; Kmita, Marie] McGill Univ, Dept Expt Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada",Institut de Recherche Clinique de Montreal (IRCM); Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; McGill University,"Kmita, M (corresponding author), Inst Rech Clin Montreal, Genet & Dev Res Unit, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada.;Kmita, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.;Kmita, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Expt Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada.",Ines.Desanlis@ircm.qc.ca; Racheal.Paul@ircm.qc.ca; Marie.Kmita@ircm.qc.ca,,"Paul, Rachel/0000-0002-1421-0637",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [PJT-162143]; IRCM-Jean Coutu fellowship,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); IRCM-Jean Coutu fellowship,"This research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, grant number PJT-162143.

Across 143 healthy, community-dwelling adults 19-79 years of age, we estimated structural network properties from diffusion-weighted imaging and functional network properties from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We confirmed previous reports of age-related decline in the strength and efficiency of structural networks, as well as in the connectivity strength within and between structural network modules. Functional networks, in contrast, exhibited age-related decline only in system segregation, a measure of the distinctiveness among network modules. Aging was associated with decline in a composite measure of fluid cognition, particularly tests of executive function. Functional system segregation was a significant mediator of age-related decline in executive function. Structural network properties did not directly influence the age-related decline in functional system segregation. The raw correlational data underlying the graph theoretical measures indicated that structural connectivity exerts a limited constraint on age-related decline in functional connectivity.

At the same time, aggregating them into broad topics or issues often is too coarse and loses nuance. Both theoretically and methodologically, the analysis of an appropriate intermediate level of aggregation is underdeveloped. This article advances research in various areas of journalism studies by developing a theoretical argument for introducing the news event as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide two approaches: One based on traditional tf center dot idf based cosine similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events. We apply this method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the events they cover.","[Trilling, Damian; van Hoof, Marieke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Trilling, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.c.trilling@uva.nl,,"van Hoof, Marieke/0000-0002-4117-837X; Patowary, Pompy/0000-0002-9802-0469; Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352",SURF Cooperative,SURF Cooperative,This work was carried out on the Dutch national e-infrastructure with the support of SURF Cooperative.,,59,8,8,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Such relatedness measures are commonly based on overlapping references (i.e., bibliographic coupling) or citations (i.e., co-citation) and can then be used with cluster analysis to find boundaries between research fields. Unfortunately, calculating a relatedness measure is challenging, especially for a large number of items, because the computational complexity is greater than linear. We propose an alternative method for identifying research fronts that uses direct citation inspired by relatedness measures. Our novel approach simply replicates a node into two distinct nodes: a citing node and cited node. We then apply typical clustering methods to the modified network. Clusters of citing nodes should emulate those from the bibliographic coupling relatedness network, while clusters of cited nodes should act like those from the co-citation relatedness network. In validation tests, our proposed method demonstrated high levels of similarity with conventional relatedness-based methods. We also found that the clustering results of the proposed method outperformed those of conventional relatedness-based measures regarding similarity with natural language processing-based classification.

An extensive machine learning based analysis of the REGARDS dataset is conducted, evaluating the CoNet and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) network inference methods, along with the Louvain, Leiden and NBR-Clust clustering techniques. Results from analysis involving five internal cluster evaluation indices show the traditional KNN inference method and NBR-Clust and Louvain clustering produce the most promising clusters with medical phenotype data. It is also shown that visualization can aid in interpreting the clusters, and that the clusters produced can identify meaningful groups indicating customized interventions.","[Kramer, Jordan; Boone, Lyric; Clifford, Thomas; Bruce, Justin; Matta, John] Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Matta, J (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",jkramer@siue.edu; lyboone@siue.edu; tcliffo@siue.edu; jubruce@siue.edu; jmatta@siue.edu,,"Boone, Lyric/0000-0001-5161-0587; Matta, John/0000-0002-7666-1409",,,,,48,7,10,1,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2194,2168-2208,,IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH,IEEE J.

Although tremendous effort has been put into cell-type annotation, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.","[Brbic, Maria; Leskovec, Jure] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zitnik, Marinka] Harvard Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Sheng; Altman, Russ B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pisco, Angela O.; Altman, Russ B.; Darmanis, Spyros; Leskovec, Jure] Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA USA",Stanford University; Harvard University; Stanford University,"Leskovec, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Leskovec, J (corresponding author), Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA USA.",jure@cs.stanford.ed,"Darmanis, Spyros/ABG-4670-2020","Darmanis, Spyros/0000-0003-4002-8158; Brbic, Maria/0000-0002-1120-1778; wang, sheng/0000-0002-5718-7529; Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X","DARPA [FA865018C7880, N660011924033]; ARO [W911NF-16-1-0342, W911NF-16-1-0171]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [OAC-1835598, OAC-1934578, CCF-1918940, IIS-2030477]; Stanford Data Science Initiative; Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Amazon; Boeing; Chase; Docomo; Hitachi; JD.com; NVIDIA; Dell; NSF [IIS-2030459, IIS-2033384]; Harvard Data Science Initiative; CZ Biohub; NIH [GM102365]",DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); ARO; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Stanford Data Science Initiative; Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub(Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)); Amazon; Boeing; Chase; Docomo; Hitachi; JD.com; NVIDIA(Nvidia Corporation); Dell; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard Data Science Initiative; CZ Biohub; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"We gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under nos.

As such, analysis of social media data during the COVID-19 pandemic can produce unique insights into discussion topics and how those topics evolve over the course of the pandemic. In this study, we propose analyzing discussion topics on Twitter by clustering hashtags. In order to obtain high-quality clusters of the Twitter hashtags, we also propose a novel multi-view clustering technique that incorporates multiple different data types that can be used to describe how users interact with hashtags. The results of our multi-view clustering show that there are distinct temporal and topical trends present within COVID-19 twitter discussion. In particular, we find that some topical clusters of hashtags shift over the course of the pandemic, while others are persistent throughout, and that there are distinct temporal trends in hashtag usage.

Analysis of incomplete data leads to skewed or misleading results. In this paper, we investigate limitations of learning to complete partially observed networks via node querying. Concretely, we study the following problem: given (i) a partially observed network, (ii) the ability to query nodes for their connections (e.g., by accessing an API), and (iii) a budget on the number of such queries, sequentially learn which nodes to query in order to maximally increase observability. We call this querying process Network Online Learning and present a family of algorithms called NOL*. These algorithms learn to choose which partially observed node to query next based on a parameterized model that is trained online through a process of exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world networks show that (i) it is possible to sequentially learn to choose which nodes are best to query in a network and (ii) some macroscopic properties of networks, such as the degree distribution and modular structure, impact the potential for learning and the optimal amount of random exploration.","[LaRock, Timothy; Sakharov, Timothy; Eliassi-Rad, Tina] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Eliassi-Rad, Tina] Northeastern Univ, Khoury Coll Comp Sci, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bhadra, Sahely] Indian Inst Technol Palakkad, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Palakkad 678557, Kerala, India",Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Palakkad,"LaRock, T (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",larock.t@husky.neu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [NSF CNS-1314603, NSF IIS-1741197]; Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-13-2-0045]; Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force [FA8702-15-D-0001]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory; Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force,"This research was sponsored in part by (1) the National Science Foundation grants NSF CNS-1314603 and NSF IIS-1741197, (2) the Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-13-2-0045 (ARL Cyber Security CRA), and (3) the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force Contract No. FA8702-15-D-0001.

The paper at hand introduces a novel unsupervised technique to semantically identify the position of an autonomous agent in unknown environments. When the robot explores a certain path for the first time, community detection is achieved through graph-based segmentation. This allows the agent to semantically define its surroundings in future traverses even if the environment's lighting conditions are changed. The proposed semantic clustering technique exploits the Louvain community detection algorithm, which constitutes a novel and efficient method for identifying groups of measurements with consistent similarity. The produced communities are combined with metric information, as provided by the robot's odometry through a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. The suggested algorithm is evaluated in indoors and outdoors datasets creating topological maps capable of assisting semantic localization. We demonstrate that the system categorizes the places correctly when the robot revisits an environment despite the possible lighting variation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood(2). To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing-such as senescence(3), genomic instability(4) and changes in the immune system(2). This transcriptomic atlas-which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or 'Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas'-provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.","[Almanzar, Nicole; Kuo, Christin S.; Min, Dullei; Weinberg, Kenneth; Xiang, Jinyi] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Pulm Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Antony, Jane; Baghel, Ankit S.; Bakerman, Isaac; Bansal, Ishita; Beachy, Philip A.; Clarke, Michael F.; Demir, Kubilay; Fish, Matt; George, Benson M.; Gulati, Gunsagar S.; Isobe, Taichi; Kao, Kevin S.; Kershner, Aaron M.; Kiss, Bernhard M.; Kong, William; Lu, Wan-Jin; Manjunath, Anoop; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Noh, Joseph; Qi, Zhen; Schaum, Nicholas; Sikandar, Shaheen S.; Sinha, Rahul; Szade, Krzysztof; Dulgeroff, Laughing Bear Torrez; van Weele, Linda J.; Weissman, Irving L.; Wu, Sean M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bakerman, Isaac; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Wu, Sean M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Cardiovasc Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bakerman, Isaac; Ebadi, Hamid; Li, Guang; Nguyen, Patricia K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barres, Ben A.; Li, Qingyun; Zhou, Lu] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beachy, Philip A.; Brownfield, Douglas; Espinoza, F.

However, it remains challenging to address the cellular diversity of such associations. Results: Here, we do not rely on the conventional assumption that the same association holds throughout the entire cell population. Instead, we assume that associations may exist in a certain subset of the cells. We developed CEllular Niche Association (CENA) to reliably predict pairwise associations together with the cell subsets in which the associations are detected. CENA does not rely on predefined subsets but only requires that the cells of each predicted subset would share a certain characteristic state. CENA may therefore reveal dynamic modulation of dependencies along cellular trajectories of temporally evolving states. Using simulated data, we show the advantage of CENA over existing methods and its scalability to a large number of cells. Application of CENA to real biological data demonstrates dynamic changes in associations that would be otherwise masked.","[Levy, Maya; Frishberg, Amit; Gat-Viks, Irit] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Mol Cell Biol & Biotechnol, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Gat-Viks, I (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Mol Cell Biol & Biotechnol, Tel Aviv, Israel.",iritgv@gmail.com,,"Frishberg, Amit/0000-0002-6912-9801",Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [288/16]; European Research Council [63788]; Koret-UC Berkeley-Tel AvivUniversity Initiative in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Edmond J.

Networks appear naturally in many fields of science and are often inherently complex structures. Many complex networks show signs of modular structure, uncovered by community detection. Communities allow researchers to understand better the network by reducing its complexity. This study analyzes the inter-regional commuting systems of the Attica Region in Greece, employing the approach of detection of complex network communities. In particular, in this paper, the administrative units of Attica are presented as a complex network, using the daily commuting as a criterion for the existence of a functional relationship and the identification of network communities (Functional Urban Areas). Network communities are identified through the modularity maximization method used to analyze complex networks. In parallel with this, through regression model application, the main factors affecting the out-commuting intensity of the municipalities of Attica are defined. The conclusions reached are of special interest to urban planning and especially to Greece, as commuting in this country has not been studied yet extensively.","[Stefanouli, Maria; Polyzos, Serafeim] Univ Thessaly, Sch Engn, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Stefanouli, M (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Sch Engn, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Greece.",mstefanouli@gmail.com; spolyzos@uth.gr,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,9,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,APR,2020,13.0,1,,,,,21,40,,10.6092/1970-9870/6280,0.0,,,20,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,LK5KP,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000530905400003,0

Similarities among individuals form communities as the basic constitutions of social networks. Regarding the importance of communities, community detection is a fundamental step in the study of social networks typically modeled as large-scale graphs. Detecting communities in such large-scale graphs which generally suffers from the curse of dimensionality is the main objective followed in this study. An efficient modularity-based community detection algorithm called MDPCluster is introduced in order to detect communities in large-scale graphs in a timely manner. To address the high dimensionality problem, first, a Louvain-based algorithm is utilized by MDPCluster to distinguish initial communities as super-nodes and then a Modified Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, called MDPSO is leveraged to detect communities through maximizing modularity measure. MDPSO discretizes Particle Swarm Optimization using the idea of transmission tendency and also escapes from premature convergence thereby a mutation operator inspired by Genetic Algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method, six standard datasets, i.e., American College Football, Books about US Politics, Amazon Product Co-purchasing, DBLP, GR-QC and HEP-TH have been employed. The first two are known as synthetic datasets whereas the rest are real-world datasets. In comparison to eight state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., Stationary Genetic Algorithm, Generational Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing-Stationary Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing-Generational Genetic Algorithm, Grivan-Newman, Danon and Label Propagation Algorithm, the results indicate the superiorities of MDCluster in terms of modularity, Normalized Mutual Information and execution time as well.","[Shirjini, Mahsa Fozuni; Farzi, Saeed; Nikanjam, Amin] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Fac Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran",K.

A fundamental goal of developmental and stem cell biology is to map the developmental history (ontogeny) of differentiated cell types. Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled the construction of comprehensive transcriptional atlases of adult tissues and of developing embryos from measurements of up to millions of individual cells. Parallel advances in sequencing-based lineage-tracing methods now facilitate the mapping of clonal relationships onto these landscapes and enable detailed comparisons between molecular and mitotic histories.

However, these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies generate an extraordinary amount of data, which creates analysis and interpretation challenges. Additionally, scRNA-seq datasets often contain technical sources of noise owing to incomplete RNA capture, PCR amplification biases and/or batch effects specific to the patient or sample. If not addressed, this technical noise can bias the analysis and interpretation of the data. In response to these challenges, a suite of computational tools has been developed to process, analyse and visualize scRNA-seq datasets. Although the specific steps of any given scRNA-seq analysis might differ depending on the biological questions being asked, a core workflow is used in most analyses. Typically, raw sequencing reads are processed into a gene expression matrix that is then normalized and scaled to remove technical noise. Next, cells are grouped according to similarities in their patterns of gene expression, which can be summarized in two or three dimensions for visualization on a scatterplot. These data can then be further analysed to provide an in-depth view of the cell types or developmental trajectories in the sample of interest. This Review provides the non-expert reader with an overview of the different steps involved in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. The authors also provide insight into the strengths and pitfalls of available analysis tools.","[Wu, Yan; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Zhang, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kzhang@bioeng.ucsd.edu,"Zhang, Kun/ABE-6349-2020; zhang, kun/HPB-5142-2023","Zhang, Kun/0000-0002-7596-5224;","NIH [U01MH098977, R01HL123755, U54HL145608, UH3DK114933, R01HG009285]",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The authors were supported by NIH grants U01MH098977, R01HL123755, U54HL145608, UH3DK114933 and R01HG009285.",,109,66,75,2,73,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1759-5061,1759-507X,,NAT REV NEPHROL,Nat.

The Brazilian Chamber of deputies is characterized by a multi-party political system. Thus, we would expect a broad spectrum of ideas to be represented. Our results, however, revealed that plurality of ideas is not present at all: the effective number of communities representing ideas based on agreement/disagreement in propositions is about 3 over the entire studied time span. The obtained results also revealed different patterns of coalitions between distinct parties.

We propose a principled methodology for evaluating the accuracy of clustering solutions obtained using these relatedness measures. We formally show that the proposed methodology has an important consistency property. The empirical analyses that we present are based on publications in the fields of cell biology, condensed matter physics, and economics. Using the BM25 text-based relatedness measure as the evaluation criterion, we find that bibliographic coupling relations yield more accurate clustering solutions than direct citation relations and cocitation relations. The so-called extended direct citation approach performs similarly to or slightly better than bibliographic coupling in terms of the accuracy of the resulting clustering solutions. The other way around, using a citation-based relatedness measure as evaluation criterion, BM25 turns out to yield more accurate clustering solutions than other text-based relatedness measures.","[Waltman, Ludo; Van Eck, Nees Jan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, Leiden, Netherlands; [Boyack, Kevin W.] SciTech Strategies Inc, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Colavizza, Giovanni] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Amsterdam,"Waltman, L (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",waltmanlr@cwts.leidenuniv.nl,"; van Eck, Nees Jan/B-6042-2008","Colavizza, Giovanni/0000-0002-9806-084X; Boyack, Kevin/0000-0001-7814-8951; van Eck, Nees Jan/0000-0001-8448-4521; Waltman, Ludo/0000-0001-8249-1752",Swiss National Fund [P1ELP2_168489]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P1ELP2_168489] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Fund(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"Part of this research was conducted when Giovanni Colavizza was affiliated with the Digital Humanities Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

However, grasping the trends in sustainability research is difficult because studies are not devised and conducted in a top-down manner with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To understand the bottom-up research activities, we analyzed over 300,000 publications concerned with sustainability by using citation network analysis and natural language processing. The results suggest that sustainability science's diverse and dynamic changes have been occurring over the last few years; several new topics, such as nanocellulose and global health, have begun to attract widespread scientific attention. We further examined the relationship between sustainability research subjects and SDGs and found significant correspondence between the two. Moreover, we extracted SDG topics that were discussed following a convergent approach in academic studies, such as inclusive society and early childhood development, by observing the convergence of terms in the citation network. These results are valuable for government officials, private companies, and academic researchers, empowering them to understand current academic progress along with research attention devoted to SDGs.","[Asatani, Kimitaka; Yamano, Hiroko; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Takeda, Haruo] Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo 1008280, Japan",University of Tokyo; Hitachi Limited,"Asatani, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",asatani@ipr-ctr.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; haruo.takeda.vp@hitachi.com; yamano@pari.u-tokyo.ac.jp; isakata@ipr-ctr.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Asatani, Kimitaka/0000-0003-3595-8940; SAKATA, ICHIRO/0000-0001-5881-3790","NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization), the funding agency of the Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)","NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization), the funding agency of the Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)","This project was funded by NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization), the funding agency of the Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).",,42,18,18,2,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2020,13.0,4,,,,,,,975,10.3390/en13040975,0.0,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,KY3TB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000522492700203,0

Unfortunately, detecting the optimal partition of a network is a computationally demanding task, usually conducted by means of optimization methods. Among them, randomized search heuristics have been proven to be efficient approaches. This manuscript is devoted to providing an overview of community detection problems from the perspective of bio-inspired computation. To this end, we first review the recent history of this research area, placing emphasis on milestone studies contributed in the last five years. Next, we present an extensive experimental study to assess the performance of a selection of modern heuristics over weighted directed network instances. Specifically, we combine seven global search heuristics based on two different similarity metrics and eight heterogeneous search operators designed ad-hoc. We compare our methods with six different community detection techniques over a benchmark of 17 Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi network instances. Ranking statistics of the tested algorithms reveal that the proposed methods perform competitively, but the high variability of the rankings leads to the main conclusion: no clear winner can be declared. This finding aligns with community detection tools available in the literature that hinge on a sequential application of different algorithms in search for the best performing counterpart. We end our research by sharing our envisioned status of this area, for which we identify challenges and opportunities which should stimulate research efforts in years to come. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, information regarding the cell-type-specific expression patterns is needed to prioritise potential pathogenic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Thanks to technological advances within next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to obtain detailed cell-type-specific expression patterns in the testis by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, to interpret single-cell RNA sequencing data properly, substantial knowledge of the highly sophisticated data processing and visualisation methods is needed. Here we review the complex cellular structure of the human testis in different types of azoospermia and outline how known genetic alterations affect the pathology of the testis. We combined the currently available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets originating from the human testis into one dataset covering 62,751 testicular cells, each with a median of 2637 transcripts quantified. We show what effects the most common data-processing steps have, and how different visualisation methods can be used. Furthermore, we calculated expression patterns in pseudotime, and show how splicing rates can be used to determine the velocity of differentiation during spermatogenesis. With the combined dataset we show expression patterns and network analysis of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Finally, we provide the combined dataset as an interactive online resource where expression of genes and different visualisation methods can be explored (https://testis.cells.ucsc.edu/).","[Soraggi, Samuele; Riera, Meritxell; Schierup, Mikkel H.] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Rajpert-De Meyts, Ewa; Almstrup, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Dept Growth & Reprod, GR-5064,Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rajpert-De Meyts, Ewa; Almstrup, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Int Ctr Res & Res Training Endocrine Disrupt Male, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet; Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen,"Almstrup, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Dept Growth & Reprod, GR-5064,Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Almstrup, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Int Ctr Res & Res Training Endocrine Disrupt Male, Copenhagen, Denmark.",kristian.almstrup@regionh.dk,"Rajpert-De Meyts, Ewa/H-6526-2019; Schierup, Mikkel Heide/AAM-4997-2020; Almstrup, Kristian/C-4668-2008; Soraggi, Samuele/AAI-7224-2020; Soraggi, Samuele/B-6914-2015","Rajpert-De Meyts, Ewa/0000-0002-5946-7559; Schierup, Mikkel Heide/0000-0002-5028-1790; Almstrup, Kristian/0000-0002-1832-0307; Soraggi, Samuele/0000-0002-1159-5535",Danish Council for Independent Research \ Natural Sciences [6108-00385A]; Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF17OC0031004],Danish Council for Independent Research \ Natural Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Novo Nordisk Foundation(Novo Nordisk FoundationNovocure Limited),"The Danish Council for Independent Research vertical bar Natural Sciences (Grant Number 6108-00385A), and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (Grant Number NNF17OC0031004) to MHS.",,132,24,25,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-6717,1432-1203,,HUM GENET,Hum.

With these data, we build a topic-view network and compare network disruption strategies with the real police work. Only 7.4% of the forum users share relevant content, and the topological features of this core differ markedly from other clandestine networks. Approximately 60% of the core users need to be targeted to fully break the network connectivity, while the real effect of the arrests was similar to random failure. Despite this topological robustness, the overall viewership network was still well disrupted by the arrests, because only 10 users contributed to almost 1/3 of the total post views and 8 of these were apprehended. Moreover, the users who were arrested provided a total of 60% of the viewed content. These results indicate that for similar online systems, aiming at the users that concentrate the views may lead to more efficient police interventions than focusing on the overall connectivity.","[da Cunha, Bruno Requiao; Passold, Jean Fernando; dos Santos, Luiz Walmocyr, Jr.] Fed Police, Rio Grande Sul Superintendency, BR-90160093 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [da Cunha, Bruno Requiao; MacCarron, Padraig; Oliveira, Kleber A.; Gleeson, James P.] Univ Limerick, Dept Math & Stat, MACSI, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland; [MacCarron, Padraig] Univ Limerick, Ctr Social Issues Res, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland",University of Limerick; University of Limerick,"da Cunha, BR (corresponding author), Fed Police, Rio Grande Sul Superintendency, BR-90160093 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;da Cunha, BR (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Dept Math & Stat, MACSI, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland.",cunha.brc@dpf.gov.br,"da Cunha, Bruno Requi√£o/B-2373-2015","da Cunha, Bruno Requi√£o/0000-0002-9985-6030; A.

The tempo of somite formation is controlled by a molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock(1,2). Although this oscillator has been well-characterized in model organisms(1,2), whether a similar oscillator exists in humans remains unknown. Genetic analyses of patients with severe spine segmentation defects have implicated several human orthologues of cyclic genes that are associated with the mouse segmentation clock, suggesting that this oscillator might be conserved in humans(3). Here we show that human PSM cells derived in vitro-as well as those of the mouse(4)-recapitulate the oscillations of the segmentation clock. Human PSM cells oscillate with a period two times longer than that of mouse cells (5 h versus 2.5 h), but are similarly regulated by FGF, WNT, Notch and YAP signalling(5). Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that mouse and human PSM cells in vitro follow a developmental trajectory similar to that of mouse PSM in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FGF signalling controls the phase and period of oscillations, expanding the role of this pathway beyond its classical interpretation in 'clock and wavefront' models(1). Our work identifying the human segmentation clock represents an important milestone in understanding human developmental biology. Human presomitic mesoderm cells derived in vitro demonstrate oscillations of the segmentation clock, thus providing a window into an otherwise inaccessible stage of human development.","[Diaz-Cuadros, Margarete; Budjan, Christoph; Hubaud, Alexis; Tarazona, Oscar A.; Donelly, Sophia; Michaut, Arthur; Al Tanoury, Ziad; Pourquie, Olivier] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Diaz-Cuadros, Margarete; Budjan, Christoph; Hubaud, Alexis; Tarazona, Oscar A.; Donelly, Sophia; Michaut, Arthur; Al Tanoury, Ziad; Pourquie, Olivier] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wagner, Daniel E.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yoshioka-Kobayashi, Kumiko; Kageyama, Ryoichiro] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Life & Med Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Niino, Yusuke; Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN Ctr Brain Sci, Lab Cell Funct & Dynam, Saitama, Japan; [Touboul, Jonathan] Brandeis Univ, Dept Math, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Touboul, Jonathan] Brandeis Univ, Volen Natl Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA USA; [Pourquie, Olivier] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Kyoto University; RIKEN; Brandeis University; Brandeis University; Harvard University,"Pourqui√©, O (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Pourqui√©, O (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Pourqui√©, O (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Miyawaki, Atsushi/KGK-3647-2024; Pourqui√©, Olivier/CAJ-5443-2022; Miyawaki, Atsushi/K-3569-2014","Miyawaki, Atsushi/0000-0001-6126-1464; Pourqui√©, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227; Yoshioka-Kobayashi, Kumiko/0009-0004-7225-2693; Budjan, Christoph/0000-0002-1563-9750; Touboul, Jonathan/0000-0003-1366-0414; Hubaud, Alexis/0000-0003-1249-4282; Kageyama, Ryoichiro/0000-0002-5985-1120; Diaz Cuadros, Margarete/0000-0002-1459-3957; MICHAUT, Arthur/0000-0003-1226-0021; Wagner, Daniel/0000-0002-2983-635X","National Institute of Health [5R01HD085121, 1K99GM121852]; NSF GRFP; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [F31HD100033] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"We thank members of the Pourquie laboratory, D.

Many disciplines such as design, planning, scheduling, and manufacturing execution need to be carefully engineered and coordinated to create successful product assembly plans. Recent research in the field of design for assembly has proposed new methodologies to design product structures in such a way that their assembly is easier. However, present assembly planning approaches lack the engineering tool support to capture all the constraints associated to assembly planning in a unified manner. This paper proposes COMPOSITIONALPLANNING, a string diagram based framework for assembly planning. In the proposed framework, string diagrams and their compositional properties serve as the foundation for an engineering tool where CAD designs interact with planning and scheduling algorithms to automatically create high-quality assembly plans. These assembly plans are then executed in simulation to measure their performance and to visualize their key build characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach in the LEGO assembly domain. We developed two reference LEGO CAD models that are processed by COMPOSITIONALPLANNING'S algorithmic pipeline. We compare sequential and parallel assembly plans in a Minecraft simulation and show that the time-to-build performance can be optimized by our algorithms.","[Master, Jade] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; [Patterson, Evan] Stanford Univ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yousfi, Shahin; Canedo, Arquimedes] Siemens Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Stanford University; Siemens AG,"Canedo, A (corresponding author), Siemens Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jmast003@ucr.edu; evan@epatters.org; arquimedes.canedo@siemens.com,,"Patterson, Evan/0000-0002-8600-949X; Master, Jade/0000-0003-1970-6030",,,,,30,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-54249-8; 978-3-030-54248-1,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2020,12169.0,,,,,,167,183,,10.1007/978-3-030-54249-8_14,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Mathematics, Applied; Logic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BS3JG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000711951500014,0

As observed recently, such issues have a critical role in the economic debate and political polarization. In this context, this paper reports on a study for the detection of hidden communities and influential users on social networks through the analysis of Twitter posts during Brazil mega oil fields auction in 2019. We use a methodology focused on identifying relevant users for the target community and discovering the effects of interactions between interest groups based on the modeling of the oil and gas social network. Firstly, we applied a standard community detection algorithm called Louvain method. Next, we used the Herfindahl-Hirschman index to identify the most influential users in the network by measuring the distribution of users' influence in a community. As a result, it was possible to visualize the presence of clusters and specific topics of interest shared by the most influential communities. Moreover, it was also possible to distinguish the convergent and divergent opinions that permeated the pre-salt auction and the level of Twitter engagement of key players from the global energy market.","[Rubin, Francis Spiegel; Alvim, Adriana C.

These collaborations also improve interpretability and trust in translational ML methods and ultimately aim to result in generalizable and reproducible models. To help clinicians and bioinformaticians refine their translational ML pipelines, we review the steps from model building to the use of ML in the clinic. We discuss experimental setup, computational analysis, interpretability and reproducibility, and emphasize the challenges involved. We highly advise collaboration and data sharing between consortia and institutes to build multi-centric cohorts that facilitate ML methodologies that generalize across centers. In the end, we hope that this review provides a way to streamline translational ML and helps to tackle the challenges that come with it.","[Couckuyt, Artuur; Seurinck, Ruth; Emmaneel, Annelies; Quintelier, Katrien; Novak, David; Van Gassen, Sofie; Saeys, Yvan] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium; [Couckuyt, Artuur; Seurinck, Ruth; Emmaneel, Annelies; Quintelier, Katrien; Novak, David; Van Gassen, Sofie; Saeys, Yvan] VIB UGent Ctr Inflammat Res, Data Min & Modeling Biomed, Ghent, Belgium; [Quintelier, Katrien] Erasmus MC, Dept Pulm Dis, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Ghent University; Ghent University; Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Saeys, Y (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium.;Saeys, Y (corresponding author), VIB UGent Ctr Inflammat Res, Data Min & Modeling Biomed, Ghent, Belgium.",yvan.saeys@ugent.be,"Saeys, Yvan/C-1311-2009","Saeys, Yvan/0000-0002-0415-1506; Novak, David/0000-0003-4574-9093; Couckuyt, Artuur/0000-0001-7858-6521; Quintelier, Katrien/0000-0001-5306-5615; Van Gassen, Sofie/0000-0002-7119-5330; Emmaneel, Annelies/0000-0003-4569-2330",Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen; FWO-TBM program [FWOTBM20190001]; Grand Challenges Program of VIB; Flemish Government [VR 2016 2312 Doc.1521/4]; FWO postdoctoral research grant (Research Foundation-Flanders),Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen; FWO-TBM program; Grand Challenges Program of VIB; Flemish Government; FWO postdoctoral research grant (Research Foundation-Flanders)(FWO),The research leading to these results has received funding from the Flemish Government under the Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen and from the FWO-TBM program (FWOTBM20190001).

Therefore, different algorithms and metrics have been suggested in order to identify these structures in graphs. In this work, we propose a new benchmark and a new approach based on a metric known as surprise. We compare our approach to several others in the literature, in different kinds of benchmarks, including our own (that tackles separately the different ways in which one may degrade a network's community structure) and discuss the different biases we identify for each algorithm and benchmark. In particular, we identify a possible flaw in the way the LFR benchmark constructs its communities and that algorithms suffering from bad resolution are biased towards identifying communities with similar sizes. We show that the surprise based approaches perform better than the modularity based ones, specially for heterogeneous graphs (with very different community sizes coexisting). (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients and find that patients who die show CD16(hi)CD66b(lo) neutrophil and IFN-gamma(+) granzyme B+ Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical variables.","[Kuchroo, Manik] Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT USA; [Huang, Jessie; Tong, Alexander; Krishnaswamy, Smita] Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, POB 2158, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Wong, Patrick; Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Israelow, Benjamin; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Silva, Julio; Takahashi, Takehiro; Iwasaki, Akiko] Yale Univ, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT USA; [Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Hussin, Julie G.] Montreal Heart Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Shung, Dennis; Simonov, Michael; Odio, Camila D.] Yale Univ, Dept Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Burkhardt, Daniel B.; Krishnaswamy, Smita] Yale Univ, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gigante, Scott] Yale Univ, Bioinformat Program, Computat Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Godavarthi, Abhinav] Yale Univ, Dept Appl Math, New Haven, CT USA; [Rieck, Bastian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Israelow, Benjamin; Farhadian, Shelli; Ko, Albert I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Sect Infect Dis, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Ko, Albert I.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Dela Cruz, Charles S.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Sect Pulm & Crit Care Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dela Cruz, Charles S.] West Haven Connecticut Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Dept Med, West Haven, CT USA; [Hirn, Matthew J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Math, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hirn, Matthew J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Computat Math Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wilson, F.

Design/methodology/approach In order to systematize Omnichannel-centered contributions and identify future research directions for post-Covid-19, this study adopted a mixed-method study, combining a systematic literature review, a bibliometric co-citation analysis and a panel discussion by field experts. Findings In Study 1, the authors traced extant literature on Omnichannel back to its theoretical foundations, which led to the identification of four research areas in which the concept of Omnichannel is rooted. Contributions pertaining to the aforesaid research areas were discussed and submitted to a panel of experts (Study 2) after the lockdown periods. The experts gave various insights into both the past and future of Omnichannel research.

Then, we optimize the formed communities using metric information by implementing an hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data: an analysis of a friendship graph with 10,360 nodes, an analysis on how sentiments of defacers related to attack patterns, and a topical modelling based analysis to study what defacers discussed publicly on Twitter. Our analysis revealed a number of key findings: a modular and hierarchical clustering method can help discover interesting sub-communities of defacers; sentiment analysis can help categorize behaviors of defacers in terms of attack patterns; and topic modelling revealed some focus topics (politics, country-specific topics, and technical discussions) among defacers on Twitter and also geographic links of defacers sharing similar topics. We believe that these findings are useful for a better understanding of defacers' behaviors, which could help design and development of better solutions for detecting defacers and even preventing impeding defacement attacks.","[Aslan, Cagri Burak; Celebi, Fatih V.] STM Def Technol Engn & Trade Inc, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey; [Aslan, Cagri Burak] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Comp Engn Dept, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey; [Li, Shujun] Univ Kent, Sch Comp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Li, Shujun] Univ Kent, Kent Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Cyber Secur KirCCS, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Tian, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",STM; Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University; University of Kent; University of Kent; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Aslan, √áB (corresponding author), STM Def Technol Engn & Trade Inc, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey.;Aslan, √áB (corresponding author), Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Comp Engn Dept, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey.;Li, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Comp, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.;Li, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Kent Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Cyber Secur KirCCS, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",cagriaslan@gmail.com; hooklee@gmail.com,"ASLAN, √áaƒürƒ± Burak/AAA-2493-2021; Li, Shujun/A-9032-2008; Aslan, Cagri/JZT-4582-2024","ASLAN, √áaƒürƒ± Burak/0000-0003-0507-3922; Li, Shujun/0000-0001-5628-7328; Aslan, Cagri/0000-0003-0507-3922","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme [2211-C]; Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K. [EP/R033749/1]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802704]; EPSRC [EP/R033749/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K.(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported in part by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastrma Kurumu (TUBITAK)] through the Bursary Scheme under Grant 2211-C, in part by the Research Project PRIvacy-aware personal data management and Value Enhancement for Leisure Travellers'' (PriVELT) funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K., under Grant EP/R033749/1, and in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802704.",,37,5,5,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8.0,,,,,,204132.0,204143.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037015,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OS8VK,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000590436200001,0

Although diverse types of social networks have been studied so far on Twitter, social networks of migrants and natives have not been studied before. This paper aims to fill this gap by studying characteristics and behaviours of migrants and natives on Twitter. To do so, we perform a general assessment of features including profiles and tweets, and an extensive network analysis on the network. We find that migrants have more followers than friends. They have also tweeted more despite that both of the groups have similar account ages. More interestingly, the assortativity scores showed that users tend to connect based on nationality more than country of residence, and this is more the case for migrants than natives. Furthermore, both natives and migrants tend to connect mostly with natives. The homophilic behaviours of users are also well reflected in the communities that we detected. Our additional privacy risk analysis showed that Twitter data can be safely used without exposing sensitive information of the users, and minimise risk of re-identification, while respecting GDPR.","[Kim, Jisu] Max Planck Inst Demog Res, Rostock, Germany; [Pratesi, Francesca; Rossetti, Giulio] ISTI, Italian Natl Res Council, CNR, Pisa, Italy; [Sirbu, Alina] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Giannotti, Fosca] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Max Planck Society; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione Alessandro Faedo (ISTI-CNR); University of Pisa; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Demog Res, Rostock, Germany.",kim@demogr.mpg.de; francesca.pratesi@isti.cnr.it; giulio.rossetti@isti.cnr.it; alina.sirbu@unipi.it; fosca.giannotti@isti.cnr.it,"Rossetti, Giulio/AAH-7567-2020; pratesi, francesca/AAE-1901-2019; Sirbu, Alina/I-3288-2014","Rossetti, Giulio/0000-0003-3373-1240; Sirbu, Alina/0000-0002-3947-7143","Projekt DEAL; European Commission [871042, 870661]",Projekt DEAL; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

If this phenomenon reflects a fundamental property of aging remains an open question. Transcriptional changes at the cellular level are best detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). However, the diverse computational methods used for the quantification of age-related loss of cellular identity have prevented reaching meaningful conclusions by direct comparison of existing scRNAseq datasets. To address these issues we created Decibel, a Python toolkit that implements side-to-side four commonly used methods for the quantification of age-related transcriptional noise in scRNAseq data. Additionally, we developed Scallop, a novel computational method for the quantification of membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater Scallop membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. To understand the source of apparent loss of cell type identity associated with aging, we analyzed cell type-specific changes in transcriptional noise and the changes in cell type composition of the mammalian lung. No robust pattern of cell type-specific transcriptional noise alteration was found across aging lung datasets. In contrast, age-associated changes in cell type composition of the lung were consistently found, particularly of immune cells. These results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated.","[Ibanez-Sole, Olga; Ascension, Alex M.; Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J.] Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Comp Biol & Syst Biomed Grp, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Ibanez-Sole, Olga; Ascension, Alex M.; Izeta, Ander] Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Tissue Engn Grp, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J.] Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Comp Biomed Data Anal Platform, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J.] CIBER Frailty & Hlth Aging CIBERfes, Madrid, Spain; [Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J.] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain; [Izeta, Ander] Univ Navarra, Tecnun, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain",Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Biogipuzkoa; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Biogipuzkoa; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Biogipuzkoa; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERFES; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Navarra,"Ara√∫zo-Bravo, MJ (corresponding author), Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Comp Biol & Syst Biomed Grp, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.;Izeta, A (corresponding author), Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Tissue Engn Grp, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.;Ara√∫zo-Bravo, MJ (corresponding author), Biodonostia Hlth Res Inst, Comp Biomed Data Anal Platform, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.;Ara√∫zo-Bravo, MJ (corresponding author), CIBER Frailty & Hlth Aging CIBERfes, Madrid, Spain.;Ara√∫zo-Bravo, MJ (corresponding author), Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain.;Izeta, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Tecnun, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.",mararabra@yahoo.co.uk; ander.izeta@biodonostia.org,"Ascensi√≥n, Alex M./AFE-8998-2022","Ascensi√≥n, Alex M./0000-0002-0013-3052; Ibanez Sole, Olga/0000-0002-0552-9793; Izeta, Ander/0000-0003-1879-7401","Instituto de Salud Carlos III [LCF/BQ/IN18/11660065, AC17/00012, PI22/01247]; la Caixa Foundation [LCF/BQ/IN18/11660065]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [AC17/00012, PI22/01247, PI19/01621]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2020-119715GB-I00]; European Regional Development Fund [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]; H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [713673]; Eusko Jaurlaritza [PRE_2020_2_0081]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [713673] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)",Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions(Marie Curie ActionsHorizon 2020); Eusko Jaurlaritza; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"la Caixa Foundation LCF/BQ/IN18/11660065 Olga Ibanez-SoleInstituto de Salud Carlos III AC17/00012 Ander Izeta Marcos J Arauzo-BravoInstituto de Salud Carlos III PI22/01247 and PI19/01621 Ander IzetaMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovacion PID2020-119715GB-I00 Marcos J Arauzo-BravoEuropean Regional Development Fund MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 Marcos J Arauzo-BravoH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions 713673 Olga Ibanez-SoleEusko Jaurlaritza PRE_2020_2_0081 Alex M AscensionThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,64,13,13,1,6,eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,DEC 28,2022,11.0,,,,,,,,e80380,10.7554/eLife.80380,0.0,,,33,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,9D4IK,36576247.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000936062400001,0

Specifically, researchers often apply algorithms from the class of network community detection algorithms (such as the Louvain algorithm) that are general-purpose algorithms not intentionally programmed for a bibliometric task. Each algorithm has specific properties inscribed, which distinguish it from the others. It can thus be assumed that different algorithms are more or less suitable for a given bibliometric task. However, the suitability of a specific algorithm when it is applied for topic reconstruction is rarely reflected upon. Why choose this algorithm and not another? In this study, I assess the suitability of four community detection algorithms for topic reconstruction, by first deriving the properties of the phenomenon to be reconstructed-topics-and comparing if these match with the properties of the algorithms. The results suggest that the previous use of these algorithms for bibliometric purposes cannot be justified by their specific suitability for this task.","[Held, Matthias] TU Berlin, Social Studies Sci & Technol, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Held, M (corresponding author), TU Berlin, Social Studies Sci & Technol, Berlin, Germany.",matthias.held@tu-berlin.de,,"Held, Matthias/0000-0002-8541-8830",German Ministry of Education and Research [16PU17003],German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The work of MH was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Grant 16PU17003),,67,3,3,1,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",,2641-3337,,QUANT SCI STUD,Quant.

This paper presents examples on how the digitalisation of chemical processes as graphs can facilitate their study and analysis for developing alternative process designs. In a process graph, inputs, outputs and unit operations are represented as nodes and streams are edges which can be weighted using process variables such as flow rate. Once a process is represented as a graph, community detection algorithms can be applied to identify process modules and obtain their modularity. The novel approach presented is based on modular decompositions to identify highly related unit operations in a flowsheet which can be analysed for insightful directions to improve a chemical process. The approach showed to be helpful in analysing a biofuel production process by adopting a combined economic and greenhouse gas emissions analysis at a modular level for hot spot analysis and identification of opportunities for decarbonisation. In an application to process integration, CO2 capture and utilisation networks are analysed in terms of its modularity and efficiency in processing CO2. In both cases, the improved designs had higher modularity values suggesting a correlation between modularity and technical performance which needs to be investigated further. Finally, prospective applications of modularity and modular decomposition approaches to realise several digitalisation tasks are presented.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias] Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,,,Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant [540821111]; IMP [Y.62001],Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant; IMP,"This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

Understanding the modal characteristics of taxis is vital to addressing many difficulties regarding urban sustainability. The movement trajectory of taxis reflects not only the operating features of taxis themselves but also urban structure and human mobility. In this work, the taxi trajectory data of Chengdu and New York City is processed, and the corresponding urban trip networks are constructed based on geographic information systems. We empirically and systematically analyze these urban trip networks according to the network hierarchy based on complex network theory. First, we studied the low-order organization of the urban trip networks (i.e., degree distribution, cluster-degree coefficient, rich-club coefficient, and so on.). We uncover the nontrivial relationship between network density and trip distance and find that the urban trip network in Chengdu is more heterogeneous than that in New York City. Second, we investigate the meso-order organization of the urban trip networks by using community detection. The community detection results show that the community boundaries are more or less mismatched with the administrative boundaries.

In this process, redundant and cunning entries must be identified and eliminated to improve the data quality. To archive this, a comparison between all entities is performed. However, this has quadratic computational complexity. To avoid this, `blocking' limits comparisons to probable matches. This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor graph-based blocking approach utilizing state-of-the-art context-aware sentence embeddings from pre-trained transformers. Our approach maps each database tuple to a node and generates a graph where nodes are connected by edges if they are related. We then invoke unsupervised community detection techniques over this graph and treat blocking as a graph clustering problem. Our work is motivated by the scarcity of training data for entity matching in real-world scenarios and the limited scalability of blocking schemes in the presence of proliferating data. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contrastively trained embeddings on the above system and test its capabilities on four data sets exhibiting more than 6 million comparisons. We show that our block processing times on the target benchmarks vary owing to the efficient data structure of the k-nearest neighbor graph. Our results also show that our method achieves better performance in terms of F1 score when compared to current deep learning-based blocking solutions.","[Mugeni, John Bosco] Univ Tsukuba, Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Amagasa, Toshiyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Mugeni, JB (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",bosco@kde.tsukuba.ac.jp; amagasa@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1559-6915,,,APPL COMPUT REV,Appl.

Despite the numerous clustering tools developed recently, the rapid growth of scRNA-seq volumes prompts for a more (computationally) efficient clustering method. Here, we introduce Secuer, a Scalable and Efficient speCtral clUstERing algorithm for scRNA-seq data. By employing an anchor-based bipartite graph representation algorithm, Secuer enjoys reduced runtime and memory usage over one order of magnitude for datasets with more than 1 million cells. Meanwhile, Secuer also achieves better or comparable accuracy than competing methods in small and moderate benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we showcase that Secuer can also serve as a building block for a new consensus clustering method, Secuer-consensus, which again improves the runtime and scalability of state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods while also maintaining the accuracy. Overall, Secuer is a versatile, accurate, and scalable clustering framework suitable for small to ultra-large single-cell clustering tasks. Author summary Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled profiling of thousands to millions of cells, spurring the development of efficient clustering algorithms for large or ultra-large datasets. In this work, we developed an ultrafast clustering method, Secuer, for small to ultra-large scRNA-seq data. Using simulation and real datasets, we demonstrated that Secuer yields high accuracy, while saving runtime and memory usage by orders of magnitude, and that it can be efficiently scaled up to ultra-large datasets. Additionally, with Secuer as a subroutine, we proposed Secuer-consensus, a consensus clustering algorithm. Our results show that Secuer-consensus performs better in terms of clustering accuracy and runtime.","[Wei, Nana; Nie, Yating] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU Yale Joint Ctr Biostat & Data Sci, CMA Shanghai, Inst Nat Sci,MOE LSC,Sch Math Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoqi] Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoqi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Single Cell Omics, Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hua-Jun] Peking Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Precis Med Multiom Res, Sch Basic Med Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hua-Jun] Peking Univ Canc Hosp & Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Peking University,"Liu, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU Yale Joint Ctr Biostat & Data Sci, CMA Shanghai, Inst Nat Sci,MOE LSC,Sch Math Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zheng, XQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zheng, XQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Single Cell Omics, Sch Publ Hlth, Sch Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wu, HJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Precis Med Multiom Res, Sch Basic Med Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wu, HJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ Canc Hosp & Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",linliu@sjtu.edu.cn; xqzheng@shsmu.edu.cn; hjwu@pku.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiaoqi/F-6653-2010; Wu, HJ/KCJ-9225-2024","Zheng, Xiaoqi/0000-0002-1832-4404","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0900600]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [PKU2022LCXQ027, BMU2021YJ064, WF220441912]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572327, 61972257, 12090024, 12101397, 32270683]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [20JC1413800, 21ZR1431000, 21JC1402900]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project [2021SHZDZX0102]; Pujiang National Lab Grant [P22KN00524]",National Key R&D Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project; Pujiang National Lab Grant,"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0900600 to X.Z.); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (PKU2022LCXQ027 -Clinical Medicine Plus X -Young Scholars Project, Peking University and BMU2021YJ064 to H.J.W. and Shanghai Jiao Tong University Start-up Grant WF220441912 to L.

The goal is to devise algorithms that, given a maximum number of updates (e.g., edge additions and removal), strive to find the best way to perform such updates in order to hide the target community inside the community structure found by a detection algorithm. So far, community deception has only been studied for undirected networks, although many real-world networks (e.g., Twitter) are directed. One way to overcome this problem would be to treat the network as undirected. However, this approach discards potentially helpful information in the edge directions (e.g., A follows B does not imply that B follows A). The aim of this paper is threefold. First, to give an account of the state-of-the-art community deception techniques in undirected networks underlying their peculiarities.

Third, to evaluate deception techniques both in undirected and directed networks. Our experimental evaluation on a variety of (large) directed networks shows that techniques that work well for undirected networks fail short when directly applied to directed networks, thus underlying the need for specific approaches.","[Fionda, Valeria] Univ Calabria, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Via Pietro Bucci 30B, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Madi, Saif Aldeen; Pirro, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Sci, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Calabria; Sapienza University Rome,"Pirr√≤, G (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Sci, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",valeria.fionda@unical.it; madi@di.uniroma1.it; pirro@di.uniroma1.it,,"Pirro, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7499-5798; Madi, Saif Aldeen/0000-0003-0336-6131",Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,28,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",1869-5450,1869-5469,,SOC NETW ANAL MIN,Soc.

Multiobjective optimization provides an ideal framework for analyzing sustainability tradeoffs, but when four or more objectives are considered, the ability to rigorously solve problems and interpret results is lost. This necessitates an approach to systematically reduce the dimensionality of many objective problems to three or fewer objectives. In this work, an algorithm to group objectives based on their correlating nature a priori to solving the full space problem is proposed. It utilizes community detection on a novel weighted objective correlation graph to identify two or three groups of correlated objectives. Results from three representative case studies demonstrate that objective groupings obtained from this algorithm minimize the amount of tradeoff information lost and outperform intuitive groupings by economics or the environment.","[Russell, Justin M.

Sobha",,,A neighbour-similarity based community discovery algorithm,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community discovery; Neighbour-based similarity measure; Social networks; Complex networks,NETWORKS,"Discovery of communities in a network is a non-trivial task. Recently, many similarity functions have been introduced to cluster nodes of the same type, but tightness relationship between the nodes inside the clusters always remained as an issue. Another important issue is that for some difficult cases like selecting a community for a node that equally belongs to more than one community which may create an ambiguity in determining the node's best-fit community remain unaddressed in many community discovery algorithms. A single wrong prediction about a node's community may lead to an incorrect prediction for other nodes, resulting in a poor community structure. To address such issues, a Neighbour Based Community Detection(NBCD) algorithm based on two novel similarity measures using a similarity parameter alpha and a set of ground rules are proposed in this work. The similarity parameter alpha provides a choice for the user to select the tightness of the nodes within the communities. The NBCD algorithm is a two-step process: one is community detection and the next is node shifting. Extensive experiments are carried out on real-world benchmark data sets and artificial networks to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. NBCD algorithm is compared with several recent and state-of-the-art community discovery algorithms. Normalized Mutual Information(NMI), Adjusted Mutual Information(AMI), Adjusted Rand Index(ARI), F-measure and Modularity are used as the performance measures. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm, NBCD, performs well with respect to all the performance measures and performs better than the other community detection algorithms considered.","[Sahu, Shailendra; Rani, T.

Analysis of these datasets is challenging because gene expression values are highly sparse due to dropout events, and there is a lack of tools to facilitate in silico detection and annotation of regions based on their molecular content. Therefore, we develop a computational tool for detecting molecular regions and region-based Missing value Imputation for Spatially Transcriptomics (MIST). We validate MIST-identified regions across multiple datasets produced by 10x Visium Spatial Transcriptomics, using manually annotated histological images as references. We benchmark MIST against a spatial k-nearest neighboring baseline and other imputation methods designed for single-cell RNA sequencing. We use holdout experiments to demonstrate that MIST accurately recovers spatial transcriptomics missing values. MIST facilitates identifying intra-tissue heterogeneity and recovering spatial gene-gene co-expression signals. Using MIST before downstream analysis thus provides unbiased region detections to facilitate annotations with the associated functional analyses and produces accurately denoised spatial gene expression profiles. Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a relatively new technique that maps transcriptional information within a tissue. Here the authors present MIST, which detects molecular regions from spatially resolved transcriptomics and denoises the missing gene expression values by region-specific imputation.","[Wang, Linhua] Baylor Coll Med, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Program Quantitat & Computat Biosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana; Liu, Zhandong] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana; Liu, Zhandong] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine,"Liu, ZD (corresponding author), Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Liu, ZD (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",zhandonl@bcm.edu,"Wang, Linhua/GRR-3312-2022","Wang, Linhua/0000-0002-6717-860X; Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana/0000-0002-6548-4662; Liu, Zhandong/0000-0002-7608-0831",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [P50HD103555]; Chao Endowment,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health; Chao Endowment,Research reported in this publication was partially supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number P50HD103555 for use of the Bioinformatics Core facilities.

However, most single-cell analyses neglect the nested structures while detecting and visualizing the functional diversity. Here, we incorporate cell hierarchy to study functional diversity at subpopulation, club (i.e., sub-subpopulation), and cell layers. Accordingly, we implement a package, SEAT, to construct cell hierarchies utilizing structure entropy by minimizing the global uncertainty in cell-cell graphs. With cell hierarchies, SEAT deciphers functional diversity in 36 datasets covering scRNA, scDNA, scATAC, and scRNA-scATAC multiome. First, SEAT finds optimal cell subpopulations with high clustering accuracy. It identifies cell types or fates from omics profiles and boosts accuracy from 0.34 to 1. Second, SEAT detects insightful functional diversity among cell clubs. The hierarchy of breast cancer cells reveals that the specific tumor cell club drives AREG-EGFT signaling. We identify a dense co-accessibility network of cis-regulatory elements specified by one cell club in GM12878. Third, the cell order from the hierarchy infers periodic pseudo-time of cells, improving accuracy from 0.79 to 0.89. Moreover, we incorporate cell hierarchy layers as prior knowledge to refine nonlinear dimension reduction, enabling us to visualize hierarchical cell layouts in low-dimensional space.","[Chen, Lingxi; Li, Shuai Cheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lingxi; Li, Shuai Cheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China","City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong","Li, SC (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Li, SC (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shuaicli@cityu.edu.hk,"Chen, Lingxi/AGE-3325-2022; Li, Shuaicheng/AES-6493-2022","Chen, Lingxi/0000-0002-5229-7470; Li, Shuaicheng/0000-0001-6246-6349",,,,,68,1,1,3,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-1048,1362-4962,,NUCLEIC ACIDS RES,Nucleic Acids Res.,JAN 25,2023,51.0,2,,,,,,,,10.1093/nar/gkac1044,0.0,,NOV 2022,17,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,8H3MH,36373664.0,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000885668500001,0

In this study, we used a multiomics approach to characterize the supragingival plaque microbiome of 91 Australian children, generating 658 bacterial and 189 viral metagenome-assembled genomes with transcriptional profiling and gene-expression network analysis. We developed a reproducible pipeline for clustering sample-specific genomes to integrate metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses regardless of biosample overlap. We introduce novel feature engineering and compositionally-aware ensemble network frameworks while demonstrating their utility for investigating regime shifts associated with caries dysbiosis. These methods can be applied when differential abundance modeling does not capture statistical enrichments or the results from such analysis are not adequate for providing deeper insight into disease. We identified which organisms and metabolic pathways were central in a coexpression network as well as how these networks were rewired between caries and caries-free phenotypes. Our findings provide evidence of a core bacterial microbiome that was transcriptionally active in the supragingival plaque of all participants regardless of phenotype, but also show highly diagnostic changes in the ways that organisms interact. Specifically, many organisms exhibit high connectedness with central carbon metabolism to Cardiobacterium and this shift serves a bridge between phenotypes. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that caries is a multifactorial ecological disease.","[Espinoza, Josh L.; Dupont, Chris L.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Espinoza, Josh L.; Kuelbs, Claire; Nelson, Karen E.; Dupont, Chris L.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Human Biol & Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Espinoza, Josh L.; Torralba, Manolito; Singh, Suren; Nelson, Karen E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Human Biol & Genom Med, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Leong, Pamela; Saffery, Richard; Craig, Jeffrey M.] Univ Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Epigenet, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Leong, Pamela; Saffery, Richard; Craig, Jeffrey M.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Hughes, Toby] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Dent Sch, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Craig, Jeffrey M.] Deakin Univ Sch Med, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",J.

In this case study of citation-based mappings of a research specialty, we dig deeper into the topical structures generated by the chosen mapping approaches and examine their correspondence to a sociologically informed understanding of the research specialty in question. Starting from a lexically delineated bibliometric field data set, we create an internal map of invasion biology by clustering the direct citation network with the Leiden algorithm. We obtain a topic structure that seems largely ordered by the empirical objects studied (species and habitat). To complement this view, we generate an external map of invasion biology by projecting the field data set onto the global Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) field classification. To better understand the representation of invasion biology by this global map, we use a manually coded set of invasion biological publications and investigate their citation-based interlinking with the fields defined by the global field classification. Our analysis highlights the variety of types of topical relatedness and epistemic interdependency that citations can stand for. Unless we assume that invasion biology is unique in this regard, our analysis suggests that global algorithmic field classification approaches that use citation links indiscriminately may struggle to reconstruct research specialties.","[Held, Matthias] TU Berlin, Social Studies Sci & Technol, Berlin, Germany; [Velden, Theresa] Deutsch Zentrum Hochsch & Wissenschaftsforsch DZH, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Held, M (corresponding author), TU Berlin, Social Studies Sci & Technol, Berlin, Germany.",matthias.held@tu-berlin.de,,"Held, Matthias/0000-0002-8541-8830",German Ministry of Education and Research [01PU17003]; German Research Foundation; Open Access Publication Fund of TU Berlin,German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Fund of TU Berlin,"The work of MH was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Grant 01PU17003).

Two types of common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) have become powerful tools to elucidate the inherent complexity and dynamics of the central nervous system at cellular resolution. This technology has allowed the identification of cell types and states, providing new insights into cellular susceptibilities and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative conditions. Exciting research using high throughput scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq technologies to study AD and PD is emerging. Herein we review the recent progress in understanding these neurodegenerative diseases using these state-of-the-art technologies. We discuss the fundamental principles and implications of single-cell sequencing of the human brain. Moreover, we review some examples of the computational and analytical tools required to interpret the extensive amount of data generated from these assays.

The model is compared to an ANN model using functional group counts and modularity as inputs. A dataset covering 430 molecules and temperature range between 253 and 463 K was employed to develop the models. The application of community detection resulted into 177 modules, which captured a wide range of molecular fragments and features, including polyfunctional molecules. The model was then reduced to 158 modules to improve performance considering statistical significance, correlation among inputs, relative importance in the ANN model and identification of outliers. The final modules model demonstrated improved performance on the training and test sets compared to the functional groups ANN model and showed excellent predictions for all compound classes. The model was then used to predict the viscosity of molecules potentially derived from biomass used in existing models, which served for further model validation. The final modules model showed improved performance based on the root mean squared error in comparison to existing models. This demonstrates the advantage of employing modularity and the modules identified by the community detection algorithm as molecular descriptors. The approach extends the potential of the application of community detection to molecular graphs and modularity to capture structure-property relationships for predicting molecular properties.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Zenteno, Citlalli; Valencia, Diego; Aburto, Jorge] Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,,,"Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) [540821111]; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT [781507]; [Y.62001]","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS); UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT));","This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

While individual microbial species have been found to be associated with certain disease states, increasing evidence suggests that higher-order microbial interactions may have an equal or greater contribution to host fitness. To better understand microbial community dynamics, we utilize networks to study interactions through a meta-analysis of microbial association networks between healthy and disease gut microbiomes. Taking advantage of the large number of metagenomes derived from healthy individuals and patients with various diseases, together with recent advances in network inference that can deal with sparse compositional data, we inferred microbial association networks based on co-occurrence of gut microbial species and made the networks publicly available as a resource (GitHub repository named GutNet). Through our meta-analysis of inferred networks, we were able to identify network-associated features that help stratify between healthy and disease states such as the differentiation of various bacterial phyla and enrichment of Proteobacteria interactions in diseased networks. Additionally, our findings show that the contributions of taxa in microbial associations are disproportionate to their abundances and that rarer taxa of microbial species play an integral part in shaping dynamics of microbial community interactions. Network-based meta-analysis revealed valuable insights into microbial community dynamics between healthy and disease phenotypes. We anticipate that the healthy and diseased microbiome association networks we inferred will become an important resource for human-related microbiome research.","[Lam, Tony J.; Ye, Yuzhen] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ye, YZ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",yye@indiana.edu,,,NIH [R01AI143254]; NSF [EF-2025451],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The NIH grant R01AI143254 and NSF grant EF-2025451.,,58,8,8,0,11,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,OCT 19,2022,12.0,1,,,,,,,17482,10.1038/s41598-022-22541-1,0.0,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,5L5BC,36261472.0,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000870427800084,0

First, we propose the use of hierarchical Community Detection (CD) in executables' FCGs, for the purpose of detecting groups of densely connected functions, thus partitioning them in smaller groups. Moreover, we use Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for further grouping of similar functions in hash buckets. Both techniques are used in a divide-and-conquer fashion to simplify the diffing process of the programs being compared, practically reducing it to diffing of their FCG communities and LSH buckets.","[Karamitas, Chariton] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, CENSUS SA, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Kehagias, Athanasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Karamitas, C (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, CENSUS SA, Thessaloniki, Greece.",huku@census-labs.com; kehagiat@auth.gr,,"Karamitas, Chariton/0009-0000-4078-4506",HEAL-Link Greece,HEAL-Link Greece,Open access funding provided by HEAL-Link Greece,,43,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",2263-8733,,,J COMPUT VIROL HACKI,J.

As an important key mineral, copper is widely used in the national economic construction and defense industry. This leads to fierce competition and a complex flow relationship between copper resource trading countries. Based on the perspective of the industrial chain, this paper constructs a model of the copper resource trade evolution network and trade competition network from 2001 to 2020 and analyzes the temporal, spatial evolution, and competitive characteristics of trade. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Since 2001, the global trade of copper resources has fluctuated greatly, trade competition is very intense, and the demand for copper has continued to increase. Copper ore is the most important trade, followed by refined copper, copper product, waste copper, and blister copper. (2) Copper resources have different characteristics at different stages of the industrial chain. Refined copper trade relations are the most concentrated. The copper product trade is the most stable. Community division presents different characteristics. (3) Trade relations and trade volume are highly concentrated in a few countries, and competition is unevenly distributed. Competitive relations are mainly concentrated in European and Asian countries, within Asian countries or European countries. (4) The Asia-Pacific region has reached a dominant position in the copper resource competition pattern, especially between China and Japan. Finally, this article provides some suggestions to maintain the stability of the copper resource trade and improve the ability to resist risks for China.","[Kang, Xinyu; Wang, Minxi; Wang, Taixin; Luo, Fanjie; Lin, Jing; Li, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Technology,"Wang, MX; Luo, FJ; Li, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",kangxinyu@stu.cdut.edu.cn; wangminxi@mail.cdut.edu.cn; wangtaixin@stu.cdut.edu.cn; luofanjie@stu.cdut.edu.cn; jeanreen@stu.cdut.edu.cn; lixin2012@cdut.cn,"Lin, Fan/JZT-1441-2024; Lin, Jing/JNS-7112-2023","Lin, Fan/0000-0002-7330-3833; Lin, Jing/0000-0003-2137-1655; li, xin/0000-0002-2939-4811",Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology; [YJ2021-XP004],Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology;,Funding This research was supported by Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology (YJ2021-XP004) .,,49,9,9,44,145,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

The framework brings together techniques from graph theory, applied mathematics, and dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA), separating linear PCA and its extensions. The implementation of the framework maps an abstract multidimensional set of data into reduced representations, which enable the extraction of its most important properties (features) characterizing its complexity. These reduced representations can be sign-posted by known examples to provide meaningful descriptions of the results that can spur explanations of phenomena and support or negate proposed mechanisms in each application. In this work, we focus on the clustering aspects, highlighting relatively fixed stable properties of the system under study. We include examples where clustering leads to semantic maps and representations of dynamic processes within the same display. Although the framework is composed of existing theories and methods, its usefulness is exactly that it brings together seemingly different approaches, into a common framework, revealing their differences/commonalities, advantages/disadvantages, and suitability for a given application. The framework provides a number of different computational paths and techniques to choose from, based on the dimension reduction method to apply, the clustering approaches to be used, as well as the representations (embeddings) of the data in the reduced space. Although here it is applied to just two scientific domains, neuroscience and astrophysics, it can potentially be applied in several other branches of sciences, since it is not based on any specific domain knowledge.","[Ioannides, Andreas A.; Kourouyiannis, Constantinos; Karittevlis, Christodoulos; Liu, Lichan] AAI Sci Cultural Serv Ltd, Lab Human Brain Dynam, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Michos, Ioannis; Papadopoulos, Michalis; Papaefthymiou, Evangelos; Pavlou, Orestis; Papadopoulou Lesta, Vicky; Efstathiou, Andreas] European Univ Cyprus, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Engomi, Cyprus",European University Cyprus,"Ioannides, AA (corresponding author), AAI Sci Cultural Serv Ltd, Lab Human Brain Dynam, Nicosia, Cyprus.",a.ioannides@aaiscs.com,,"Pavlou, Orestis/0000-0002-6726-7872; Papadopoulos, Michail/0000-0003-3085-0631",Cyprus Research & Innovation Foundation [4000127142]; European Space Agency (ESA) [859937]; European Union; [EXCELLENCE/1216/0207/GRATOS]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [859937] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),Cyprus Research & Innovation Foundation(Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF)); European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space Agency); European Union(European Union (EU)); ; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"The main work leading to the unified framework described here was performed under the project EXCELLENCE/1216/0207/GRATOS funded by the Cyprus Research & Innovation Foundation.

Selecting which unit operations to combine into an intensified unit is necessary in developing an intensified process that offers an inherently safer design with reduced energy demand. This paper presents a novel methodology to intensify a chemical process guided by modularity. A process network is decomposed into modules by applying a community detection algorithm to find the process units to be integrated into an intensified module to improve the Fire and Explosion Damage Index (FEDI). A case study for the separation of an ethanol-butanol-water mixture illustrates this approach. The results show that the safest design (lowest FEDI) is Alternative 1 which was developed using the approach and correlates with high modularity of 0.607. Energy use is reduced by 25.8% thus also leading to a more energy efficient process compared to the non-intensified design with a lower modularity (0.385). A rather empirically guided design was proposed as Alternative 2 which led to modularity of 0.533, but only 10% energy saving and no improvement in the FEDI. This demonstrates that intensification guided by modularity strengthens integration between the process units while improving both safety and energy efficiency. As such, the approach has a wide potential application to guide the intensification of chemical processes.","[Castillo-Landero, Arick; Aburto, Jorge; Martinez-Hernandez, Elias] Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Lazaro Cardenas 152, Mexico City 07730, Mexico; [Sadhukhan, Jhuma] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford GU2 7XH, England",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo; University of Surrey,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Lazaro Cardenas 152, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,,"Sadhukhan, Jhuma/0000-0001-6791-1421; Castillo-Landero, Arick/0000-0002-4416-0896","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant [540821111]; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; British Council; [Y.62001]","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; British Council(The British Council in India);","This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

Traditionally, cells have been classified by their morphology or by expression of certain proteins in functionally distinct settings. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies paved the way for the detection and quantitative analysis of cellular content. In this context, transcriptome quantification techniques made their advent, starting from the bulk RNA sequencing, unable to dissect the heterogeneity of a sample, and moving to the first single cell techniques capable of analyzing a small number of cells (1-100), arriving at the current single cell techniques able to generate hundreds of thousands of cells. As experimental protocols have improved rapidly, computational workflows for processing the data have also been refined, opening up to novel methods capable of scaling computational times more favorably with the dataset size and making scRNA-seq much better suited for biomedical research. In this perspective, we will highlight the key technological and computational developments which have enabled the analysis of this growing data, making the scRNA-seq a handy tool in clinical applications.","[Carangelo, Giulia] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Biomed Sci Mario Serio, Florence, Italy; [Magi, Alberto] Univ Florence, Dept Informat Engn, Florence, Italy; [Semeraro, Roberto] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence; University of Florence,"Semeraro, R (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Florence, Italy.",roberto.semeraro@unifi.it,"Magi, Alberto/M-6773-2015; Semeraro, Roberto/AAB-2193-2019","Semeraro, Roberto/0000-0003-0601-6903; Carangelo, Giulia/0000-0001-6531-1756",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [20307],Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC)(Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro),"This work has been supported by the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC Investigator Grant 20307, Third Generation Cancer Genomics).",,143,8,8,3,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

This work aimed to develop an iPSC organoid model enriched with NKX2-1(+) BTP-like cells. Building on previous studies, we optimized a directed differentiation paradigm to generate spheroids with more robust NKX2-1 expression. Spheroids were expanded into organoids that possessed NKX2-1(+)/CPM+ BTP-like cells, which increased in number over time. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a high degree of transcriptional similarity between induced BTPs (iBTPs) and in vivo BTPs. Using FACS, iBTPs were purified and expanded as induced bud tip progenitor organoids (iBTOs), which maintained an enriched population of bud tip progenitors. When iBTOs were directed to differentiate into airway or alveolar cell types using well-established methods, they gave rise to organoids composed of organized airway or alveolar epithelium, respectively. Collectively, iBTOs are transcriptionally and functionally similar to in vivo BTPs, providing an important model for studying human lung development and differentiation.","[Hein, Renee F.

This fragmentation, in unison with competing KPAs, leads to complex interdependencies between performance indicators, which results in an imbalance, with some of these indicators being penalized to the apparent benefit of others. Therefore, it is necessary to support ATM stakeholders in systematically uncovering hidden trade-offs between KPAs. Existing literature confirms this claim, but how to solve it has not been fully addressed. In this paper, we envision air traffic complexity to be the framework through which a common understanding among stakeholders is enhanced. We introduce the concept of single aircraft complexity to determine the contribution of each aircraft to the overall complexity of air traffic. Furthermore, we describe a methodology extending this concept to define complex communities, which are groups of interdependent aircraft that contribute the majority of the complexity in a certain airspace. Through use-cases based on synthetic and real historical traffic, we first show that the algorithm can serve to formalize and improve decision-making. Further, we illustrates how the provided information can be used to increase transparency of the decision makers towards different airspace users. In order to showcase the methodology, we develop a tool that visualizes different outputs of the algorithm. Lastly, we conduct sensitivity analysis in order to systematically analyse how each input affects the methodology.","[Isufaj, Ralvi; Omeri, Marsel; Piera, Miquel Angel; Valls, Jaume Saez] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Logist & Aeronaut Grp, Sabadell 08202, Spain; [Gallego, Christian Eduardo Verdonk] CRIDA AIE, Madrid 28022, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Isufaj, R (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Logist & Aeronaut Grp, Sabadell 08202, Spain.",ralvi.isufaj@uab.cat,"Piera, Miquel Angel/ABB-4197-2021","Piera, Miquel Angel/0000-0002-7227-7944; Isufaj, Ralvi/0000-0003-0839-3235; Verdonk Gallego, Christian Eduardo/0000-0003-0504-0143; Omeri, Marsel/0000-0002-4547-3202","CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM [783287]","CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM","This work was supported in part by the H2020 EngageKTN, grant agreement no. 783287, and CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM.",,29,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2226-4310,,AEROSPACE-BASEL,Aerospace,OCT,2022,9.0,10,,,,,,,613,10.3390/aerospace9100613,0.0,,,27,"Engineering, Aerospace",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,5R0QF,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000874224200001,0

Sentiment analysis results revealed that the police reports' coverage is predominantly factual and neutral and, therefore, useful for keyword-based analyses. After identifying the 46 most relevant keywords in the reports, we generated an adjacency matrix to investigate the keywords' dependencies, visualized the network and dependencies of the most relevant keywords, and categorized them into four thematic clusters using the Louvain algorithm. Our results and findings reveal that driving under drug influence, especially alcohol, is one serious problem. Riding e-scooter in pairs and on forbidden terrain or in the wrong direction are also common causes of crashes. Consequences for e-scooter riders are severe injuries, driving license revocation, fines, criminal charges, and incurring for property damage. Further, wearing protective gear and helmets is of low acceptance among the e-scooter ridership.

However, in real networks, it has been observed that a single node can have multiple roles. Here, the roles of a node can be defined in a case-by-case manner, depending on the graph data mining task. Consequently, a significant obstacle to achieving multiple-role discovery in real networks is finding the best way to select datasets for pre-labeling. To meet this challenge, this study proposes a flexible framework that extends a single-role discovery method by using domain adversarial learning to discover multiple roles for nodes. Furthermore, we propose a method to assign sub-networks, derived through community extraction methods, to a source network and a validation network as training datasets.

Detecting a community in a network means discovering a cluster of network nodes so that the density of edges between them is high. The existing methods use entire structure information or subgraphs with a fixed size to detect dense communities. Therefore, they are not efficient and accurate for large-scale networks. In this paper, the authors introduce an overlapping community detection algorithm that gradually improves density estimation by expanding the size of subgraphs and gathering information during the search process for finding communities. It is an efficient algorithm with low computational complexity for complex networks with one hundred thousand to several millions of nodes. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks with several hundred to four million nodes validate the performance assessment of the proposed method.","[Saif, Seyed Mojtaba; Hamzeh, Ali] Shiraz Univ, CSE & IT Dept, Shiraz, Fars, Iran; [Samie, Mohammad Ebrahim] Jahrom Univ, Dept Comp Engn & IT, Jahrom, Fars, Iran",Shiraz University,"Hamzeh, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, CSE & IT Dept, Shiraz, Fars, Iran.",mojtabasaif@gmail.com; Samie@jahromu.ac.ir; ali@cse.shirazu.ac.ir,"saif, mojtaba/HTS-8321-2023","Samie, M.

Weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected networks can all be used for detecting communities depending on the network structure and content. The proposed model framework for community detection is based on weighted networks. We use two important and effective concepts in graph analysis. The structural density between nodes is the first concept, and the second is the weight of edges between nodes. The proposed model advantage is using a probabilistic generative model that estimates the latent parameters of the probabilistic model and detecting the community based on the probability of the presence or absence of weighted edge. The output of the proposed model is the intensity of belonging each weighted node to the communities. A relationship between the observation of a pair of nodes in multiple communities and the probability of an edge with a high weight between them, is one of the important outputs that interpret the detected communities by finding relevancy between membership of nodes to communities and edge weight. Experiments are performed on real-world weighted networks and synthetic weighted networks to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results will show that the proposed algorithm is more density and accurate than other algorithms in weighted community detection.","[Hajibabaei, Hossein; Seydi, Vahid; Koochari, Abbas] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Seydi, Vahid] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales",Islamic Azad University; Bangor University,"Seydi, V (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.;Seydi, V (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales.",h.hajibabaei@srbiau.ac.ir; V.seydi@bangor.ac.uk; koochari@srbiau.ac.ir,"Seydi, Vahid/KHZ-7414-2024","Seydi, Vahid/0000-0001-5702-2209; hajibabaei, hossein/0009-0005-8063-981X",,,,,45,2,2,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9902,1573-7675,,J INTELL INF SYST,J.

J,"Gibson, RA; Mucha, PJ",,,,"Gibson, Ryan A.; Mucha, Peter J.",,,Finite-state parameter space maps for pruning partitions in modularity-based community detection,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MULTISCALE,"Partitioning networks into communities of densely connected nodes is an important tool used widely across different applications, with numerous methods and software packages available for community detection. Modularity-based methods require parameters to be selected (or assume defaults) to control the resolution and, in multilayer networks, interlayer coupling. Meanwhile, most useful algorithms are heuristics yielding different near-optimal results upon repeated runs (even at the same parameters). To address these difficulties, we combine recent developments into a simple to-use framework for pruning a set of partitions to a subset that are self-consistent by an equivalence with the objective function for inference of a degree-corrected planted partition stochastic block model (SBM). Importantly, this combined framework reduces some of the problems associated with the stochasticity that is inherent in the use of heuristics for optimizing modularity. In our examples, the pruning typically highlights only a small number of partitions that are fixed points of the corresponding map on the set of somewhere-optimal partitions in the parameter space. We also derive resolution parameter upper bounds for fitting a constrained SBM of K blocks and demonstrate that these bounds hold in practice, further guiding parameter space regions to consider. With publicly available code (http:// github.com/ ragibson/ Modul arity Pruning), our pruning procedure provides a new baseline for using modularity-based community detection in practice.","[Gibson, Ryan A.; Mucha, Peter J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gibson, Ryan A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Comp Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Mucha, Peter J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Appl Phys Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Mucha, Peter J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Math, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Dartmouth College,"Mucha, PJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Math, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;Mucha, PJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Appl Phys Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;Mucha, PJ (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Math, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",peter.j.mucha@dartmouth.edu,,"Gibson, Ryan/0000-0002-8238-7135","National Science Foundation [BCS-2140024, BCS-2024271]; James S.

In this paper, we investigated the patterns of intercity patient mobility and factors influencing this behavior based on >4 million hospitalization records of patients with chronic kidney disease in China. To provide practical policy recommendations, a role identification framework informed by complex network theory was proposed considering the strength and distribution of connections of cities in mobility networks. Such a mobility network features multiscale community structure with universal administrative constraints and a few boundary breaches. We discovered that cross-module visits which accounted for only 20 % of total visits, accounted for >50 % of the total travel distance. The explainable machine learning modeling results revealed that distance has a power-law-like effect on flow volume, and highquality healthcare resources are an important driving factor.

Unfortunately, such models fail to describe all those systems in which building blocks interact at a higher order. Higher-order graphs provide us the right tools for the task, but introduce a higher computing complexity due to the interaction order. In this paper we analyze the interplay between the structure of a directed hypergraph and a linear dynamical system, a random walk, defined on it. How can one extend network measures, such as centrality or modularity, to this framework? Instead of redefining network measures through the hypergraph framework, with the consequent complexity boost, we will measure the dynamical system associated to it. This approach let us apply known measures to pairwise structures, such as the transition matrix, and determine a family of measures that are amenable to such a procedure.","[Faccin, Mauro] Univ Paris, Inst Rech Dev IRD, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Faccin, Mauro] Univ Paris, Ctr Populat & Dev CEPED, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite,"Faccin, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Inst Rech Dev IRD, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.;Faccin, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Ctr Populat & Dev CEPED, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",,,"faccin, mauro/0000-0003-0706-3007",National French Agencies ANR [TRACTRUST-ANR-20-COVI-0102]; ANRS [MEDIACAM-ANRS COV24],National French Agencies ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANRS(ANRSAgence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),M.F. thanks Michael T.

Thus, the observable macroscopic 'average' cannot outright be used as representative of the 'average cell'. Rather, it is the resulting emerging behaviour of the actions and interactions of many different cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) enables the comparison of the transcriptomes of individual cells. This provides high-resolution maps of the dynamic cellular programmes allowing us to answer fundamental biological questions on their function and evolution. It also allows to address medical questions such as the role of rare cell populations contributing to disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, it provides an understanding of context-specific dependencies, namely the behaviour and function that a cell has in a specific context, which can be crucial to understand some complex diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Here, we provide an overview of scRNA-Seq, including a comparative review of emerging technologies and computational pipelines. We discuss the current and emerging applications and focus on tumour heterogeneity a clear example of how scRNA-Seq can provide new understanding of a complex disease.

The purpose of this work is to develop a novel network-based (nonparametric) dimensionality reduction analysis (NDA) method, that can be effectively applied to HDLSS data. First, with the NDA method, the correlation graph of variables is specified. With a modularity-based community detection method, the set of modules is specified. Then, the linear combination of variables weighted by their eigenvector centralities (EVCs), defined as LVs, is determined. In the optional phase of variable selection, variables with low EVCs and low communality are ignored. Then, the set of LVs and the set of indicators belonging to the LVs are specified using the NDA method. NDA is applied to publicly available databases and compared with principal factoring with community analysis (PFA) methods. The results show that NDA can be effectively applied to HDLSS datasets as it outperforms the existing methods in terms of interpretability. In addition, the application of NDA is easier, since there is no need to specify the number of latent variables due to its nonparametric nature.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.","[Liu, Qiliang; Hou, Zhaoyi; Yang, Jie] Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jie_yang@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41971353, 41730105]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ20058, 2020JJ4695]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province [KT202110, KT202002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded through support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 41971353 and 41730105), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2021JJ20058 and 2020JJ4695), and the water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province (No. KT202110 and KT202002).",,43,1,1,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4144,10.3390/rs14174144,0.0,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4K1ZE,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000851756200001,0

Pandemic response policies guided by geospatial approaches are appropriate additions to traditional epidemiological responses when addressing this disaster. However, little is known about finding the optimal set of locations or jurisdictions to create policy coordination zones. In this study, we propose optimization models and algorithms to identify coordination communities based on the natural movement of people. To do so, we develop a mixed-integer quadratic-programming model to maximize the modularity of detected communities while ensuring that the jurisdictions within each community are contiguous. To solve the problem, we present a heuristic and a column-generation algorithm. Our computational experiments highlight the effectiveness of the models and algorithms in various instances. We also apply the proposed optimization-based solutions to identify coordination zones within North Carolina and South Carolina, two highly interconnected states in the U.S. Results of our case study show that the proposed model detects communities that are significantly better for coordinating pandemic related policies than the existing geopolitical boundaries.

Interactions between countries have generally been studied using the flow of resources across diverse trade networks, in which the degree of dependence between two countries is typically measured based on the trade volume. However, indirect influences may not be immediately apparent. Herein, we compared a direct trade network to a trade network constructed using the personalized PageRank (PPR) encompassing indirect influences. By analyzing the correlation of the gross domestic product (GDP) between countries, we discovered that the PPR trade network has greater explanatory power on the propagation of economic events than direct trade by analyzing the GDP correlation between countries. To further validate our observations, an agent-based model of the spreading economic crisis was implemented for the Russia-Ukraine war of 2022. The model also demonstrates that the PPR explains the actual impact more effectively than the direct trade network.

In order to process this vast quantity of information, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are being combined with data mining to detect patterns with the aim of modeling, classifying or predicting the behavior of certain astronomical phenomena or objects. Parallel to the exponential development of the aforementioned techniques, the scientific output related to the application of AI and machine learning (ML) in astronomy and astrophysics has also experienced considerable growth in recent years. Therefore, the increasingly abundant articles make it difficult to monitor this field in terms of which research topics are the most prolific or novel, or which countries or authors are leading them. In this article, a text-mining-based scientometric analysis of scientific documents published over the last three decades on the application of AI and ML in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics is presented. The VOSviewer software and data from the Web of Science (WoS) are used to elucidate the evolution of publications in this research field, their distribution by country (including co-authorship), the most relevant topics addressed, and the most cited elements and most significant co-citations according to publication source and authorship.

Above all, single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a popular approach of analyzing chromatin accessibility differences at the level of single cell, either within or between groups. As a result, it is critical to examine cell heterogeneity at a previously unseen level and to identify both recognized and unknown cell types. However, with the ever-increasing number of cells engendered by technological development and the characteristics of the data, such as high noise, sparsity and dimension, challenges in distinguishing cell types have emerged. We propose scVAEBGM, which integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Bayesian Gaussian-mixture model (BGM) to process and analyze scATAC-seq data. This method combines and takes benefits of a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to estimate the number of cell types without determining the cluster number in a beforehand. In other words, the size of the clusters is inferred from the data, thus avoiding biases introduced by subjective assessments when manually determining the size of the clusters. Additionally, the method is more robust to noise and can better represent single-cell data in lower dimensions. We also create a further clustering strategy. It is indicated by experiments that further clustering based on the already completed clustering can improve the clustering accuracy again. We test on six public datasets, and scVAEBGM outperforms various dimension reduction baselines. In downstream applications, scVAEBGM can reveal biological cell types.

Despite the fruitful research outcomes of community detection, the discovery of irregular-shaped and statistically significant dynamic communities in vehicle movements is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an evolutionary ant colony optimization (EACO) method for detecting dynamic communities in vehicle movements. Firstly, a weighted, spatially embedded graph was constructed at each time snapshot. Then, an ant-colony-optimization-based spatial scan statistic was upgraded to identify statistically significant communities at each snapshot by considering the effects of the communities discovered at the previous snapshot. Finally, different rules defined based on the Jaccard coefficient were used to identify the evolution of the communities. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world vehicle movement datasets showed that EACO performs better than three representative dynamic community detection methods: FacetNet (a framework for analyzing communities and evolutions in dynamic networks), DYNMOGA (dynamic multi-objective genetic algorithm), and RWLA (random-walk-based Leiden algorithm).

Transport impedance among ports through transit times and port infrastructures can, however, impact accessibility, trade performance, and the attractiveness of ports. Assessments of the transit routes between ports based on performance and attractiveness criteria can provide a topological liner shipping network that quantifies the performance profile of ports. Here, we constructed a directed global liner shipping network (GLSN) of the top six liner shipping companies between the ports of Africa, Asia, North/South America, Europe, and Oceania. Network linkages and community groupings were quantified through a container port accessibility evaluation model, which quantified the performance of the port using betweenness centrality, the transport impedance among ports with the transit time, and the performance of ports using the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index. The in-degree and out-degree of the GLSN conformed to the power-law distribution, respectively, and their R-square fitting accuracy was greater than 0.96. The community partition illustrated an obvious consistence with the actual trading flow. The accessibility evaluation result showed that the ports in Asia and Europe had a higher accessibility than those of other regions. Most of the top 30 ports with the highest accessibility are Asian (17) and European (10) ports. Singapore, Port Klang, and Rotterdam have the highest accessibility. Our research may be helpful for further studies such as species invasion and the planning of ports.","[Kang, Lu; Wu, Wenzhou; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kang, Lu; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Kang, Lu; Wu, Wenzhou; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University","Wu, WZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wu, WZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",wuwz@lreis.ac.cn,,"kang, lu/0000-0002-0223-1094; Yu, Hao/0000-0002-7647-1162; Su, Fenzhen/0000-0003-4972-3595",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42006171]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA13010403],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42006171) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA13010403).,,44,6,7,13,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2022,22.0,15,,,,,,,5889,10.3390/s22155889,0.0,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,3T2LW,35957447.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000840113400001,0

In this study, we use the scientific collaboration network technique to explore the evolving history and scientific collaboration patterns of contact tracing. It is observed that the number of articles on the subject remained at a low level before 2020, probably because the practical significance of the contact tracing model was not widely accepted by the academic community. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented research boom to contact tracing, as evidenced by the explosion of the literature after 2020. Tuberculosis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases were common types of diseases studied in contact tracing before 2020. In contrast, research on contact tracing regarding COVID-19 occupies a significantly large proportion after 2000. It is also found from the collaboration networks that academic teams in the field tend to conduct independent research, rather than cross-team collaboration, which is not conducive to knowledge dissemination and information flow.","[Li, Hui; Zhu, Yifei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Niu, Yi] China Publishing Grp Digital Media Co Ltd, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Li, H (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",ray@mail.buct.edu.cn; 2020210440@mail.buct.edu.cn; niuyi@cnpubg.com,"Li, Hui/AAB-7146-2019","Li, Hui/0000-0002-8866-5941",Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences [21YJAZH040]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1636208],Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 21YJAZH040), and this research was also funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under project grants of the general technical foundation research joint fund (No. U1636208).",,61,4,5,1,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

We believe this can best be achieved through a deeper understanding of the complex ecology of a tumor tissue and the spatiotemporal relationships between its cellular and microenvironment components. Multiplexed images from patient samples facilitate this understanding. We present Mistic, an open-source multiplexed image t-SNE viewer that enables the simultaneous viewing of multiple 2D multiplexed images to provide an overall visual preview of the entire dataset. This allows an exploratory understanding of underlying patterns in the data such as the specific expression pattern of a given biomarker across all images. Currently, there is no free tool to generate such image t-SNEs. Mistic aims to fill this gap by providing an easy to implement tool with simple functionality to view multiple images at once. Mistic supports images from Vectra, CyCIF, t-CyCIF, and CODEX. Understanding the complex ecology of a tumor tissue and the spatiotemporal relationships between its cellular and microenvironment components is becoming a key component of translational research, especially in immuno-oncology. The generation and analysis of multiplexed images from patient samples is of paramount importance to facilitate this understanding. Here, we present Mistic, an open-source multiplexed image t-SNE viewer that enables the simultaneous viewing of multiple 2D images rendered using multiple layout options to provide an overall visual preview of the entire dataset. In particular, the positions of the images can be t-SNE or UMAP coordinates. This grouped view of all images allows an exploratory understanding of the specific expression pattern of a given biomarker or collection of biomarkers across all images, helps to identify images expressing a particular phenotype, and can help select images for subsequent downstream analysis.

Among others, this includes principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which aim to maximize the variance and the time scale of the first components, respectively. A crucial first step of such an analysis is the identification of suitable and relevant input coordinates (the so-called features), such as backbone dihedral angles and interresidue distances. As typically only a small subset of those coordinates is involved in a specific biomolecular process, it is important to discard the remaining uncorrelated motions or weakly correlated noise coordinates. This is because they may exhibit large amplitudes or long time scales and therefore will be erroneously considered important by PCA and TICA, respectively. To discriminate collective motions underlying functional dynamics from uncorrelated motions, the correlation matrix of the input coordinates is block-diagonalized by a clustering method. This strategy avoids possible bias due to presumed functional observables and conformational states or variation principles that maximize variance or time scales. Considering several linear and nonlinear correlation measures and various clustering algorithms, it is shown that the combination of linear correlation and the Leiden community detection algorithm yields excellent results for all considered model systems. These include the functional motion of T4 lysozyme to demonstrate the successful identification of collective motion, as well as the folding of the villin headpiece to highlight the physical interpretation of the correlated motions in terms of a functional mechanism.","[Diez, Georg; Nagel, Daniel; Stock, Gerhard] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Stock, G (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",stock@physik.uni-freiburg.de,,"Diez, Georg/0000-0002-4114-1577; Nagel, Daniel/0000-0002-2863-2646","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR 5099, 431945604, 37/935-1 FUGG]; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen,"The authors thank Matthias Post, Steffen Wolf, Sofia Sartore, and Marius Lange for fruitful discussions and D.

This graph analysis method projects a semantic value onto a given coordinated syntactic dependency and constructs a second-order lexical network of lexical collocates with a high co-occurrence measure. The subsequent process of clustering and pruning the graph reveals lexical communities with high conceptual similarity, which are interpreted as associated senses of the source lexeme. We demonstrate the theory and its application to the task of identifying the conceptual structure and different meanings of nouns, adjectives and verbs using examples from different corpora, and explain the modulating effects of linguistic and graph parameters. This graph approach is based on syntactic dependency processing and can be used as a complementary method to other contemporary natural language processing resources to enrich semantic tasks such as word disambiguation, domain relatedness, sense structure, identification of synonymy, metonymy, and metaphoricity, as well as to automate comprehensive meta-reasoning about languages and identify cross/intra-cultural discourse variations of prototypical conceptualization patterns and knowledge representations.

This approach builds on a combination of utilizing 3D model meta-data and structuring the graph using the Assembly-Part hierarchy alongside 3D Shape-based Clustering. To demonstrate our approach, from a dataset consisting of 110,770 CAD models, 92,715 models were organized into 7,651 groups of varying sizes containing highly similar shapes, demonstrating the varied nature of design repositories, but inevitably also containing a significant number of repetitive and unique designs. Using the Product Design Knowledge Graph, we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D shape retrieval using Approximate Nearest Neighbor search. Finally, we illustrate the use of the KG for Design Reuse of co-occurring components, Rule-Based Inference for Assembly Similarity and Collaborative Filtering for Multi-Modal Search of manufacturing process conditions.

Although some pioneers proposed a few algorithms for finding fuzzy communities, there is still room for further improvement in the quality of detected fuzzy communities. In this study, a metaheuristic-based modularity optimization algorithm, named symbiotic organisms search fuzzy community detection (SOSFCD) is proposed. On the one hand, an improved bioinspired metaheuristic algorithm, elite symbiotic organisms search, is designed as optimization strategy to improve the global convergence of fuzzy modularity optimization. On the other hand, a neighbor-based membership modification operation is proposed to intensify exploitation ability and speed up convergence, by efficiently utilizing local information (i.e., node neighborhood) of network topology. Experimental results on both of synthetic and real-life networks with different scales and characteristics show that SOSFCD can find max-modularity fuzzy partitions and coverings, and outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability.","[Xiao, Jing; Xu, Xiao-Ke] Dalian Minzu Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan-Jiao] Northeast Elect Power Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Jilin 132012, Jilin, Peoples R China",Dalian Minzu University; Northeast Electric Power University,"Xu, XK (corresponding author), Dalian Minzu Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China.",hrbeuxiaojing@aliyun.com; wangyanjiao1028@126.com; xuxiaoke@foxmail.com,"Zhao, Xuan/JMR-2135-2023; Gomez, Daniel/G-1586-2010; Xu, xiaoke/AAS-3266-2021; Yuan, Yi/KGL-5178-2024; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023; xu, xiaoke/GQY-8278-2022; Yao, Chen/JVD-6226-2023; zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024; xu, xiaoke/GPX-3060-2022; YE, Chen/KFR-3858-2024; Zhao, Hang/KCL-7278-2024","Gomez, Daniel/0000-0001-9548-5781; Xu, xiaoke/0000-0002-9148-3145; xu, xiaoke/0000-0002-9148-3145; xu, xiaoke/0000-0002-9148-3145;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773091]; LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program [XLYC1807106]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [2020-MZLH-22],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61773091, in part by the LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program under Grant XLYC1807106, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province under Grant 2020-MZLH-22.",,82,5,5,0,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1063-6706,1941-0034,,IEEE T FUZZY SYST,IEEE Trans.

By exploiting open-source software, DOSNs allow users to create their own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way. Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of study on user relations and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions: understanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their membership instance and/or across different instances, and unveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it represents the most widely used DOSN platform. We believe that the findings drawn from our study on Mastodon users' roles and information flow can pave a way for further development of fascinating research on DOSNs.","[La Cava, Lucio; Greco, Sergio; Tagarelli, Andrea] Univ Calabria, Dept Comp Engn Modeling Elect & Syst Engn DIMES, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Tagarelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Comp Engn Modeling Elect & Syst Engn DIMES, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",lucio.lacava@dimes.unical.it; greco@dimes.unical.it; tagarelli@dimes.unical.it,"La Cava, Lucio/AFV-5293-2022","La Cava, Lucio/0000-0003-3324-0580",,,,,34,7,7,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2468-6964,,ONLINE SOC NETW MED,Online Soc.

COPD represents one of many areas of research where identifying complex pathways and networks of interacting biomarkers is an important avenue toward studying disease progression and potentially discovering cures. Recently, sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) was developed to identify complex relationships between omics associated with a disease phenotype, such as lung function. SmCCNet uses two sets of omics datasets and an associated output phenotypes to generate a multi-omics graph, which can then be used to explore relationships between omics in the context of a disease. Detecting significant subgraphs within this multi-omics network, i.e., subgraphs which exhibit high correlation to a disease phenotype and high inter-connectivity, can help clinicians identify complex biological relationships involved in disease progression. The current approach to identifying significant subgraphs relies on hierarchical clustering, which can be used to inform clinicians about important pathways involved in the disease or phenotype of interest. The reliance on a hierarchical clustering approach can hinder subgraph quality by biasing toward finding more compact subgraphs and removing larger significant subgraphs. This study aims to introduce new significant subgraph detection techniques. In particular, we introduce two subgraph detection methods, dubbed Correlated PageRank and Correlated Louvain, by extending the Personalized PageRank Clustering and Louvain algorithms, as well as a hybrid approach combining the two proposed methods, and compare them to the hierarchical method currently in use. The proposed methods show significant improvement in the quality of the subgraphs produced when compared to the current state of the art.","[Abdel-Hafiz, Mohamed; Helmi, Shahab; Banaei-Kashani, Farnoush] Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Management & Min Lab, Denver, CO 80204 USA; [Najafi, Mesbah] Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Math, Denver, CO USA; [Pratte, Katherine A.; Bowler, Russell P.] Natl Jewish Hlth, Denver, CO USA; [Zhuang, Yonghua; Liu, Weixuan; Kechris, Katerina J.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Informat, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA; [Bowler, Russell P.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA; [Lange, Leslie] Univ Colorado, Dept Med, Div Biomed Informat & Personalized Med, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver; Children's Hospital Colorado; National Jewish Health; Colorado School of Public Health; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Abdel-Hafiz, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Management & Min Lab, Denver, CO 80204 USA.",mohamed.abdel-hafiz@cuanschutz.edu,"Zhuang, Yonghua/A-2946-2013","Zhuang, Yonghua/0000-0002-1822-2395","National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01 HL152735, R01 HL137995, U01 HL089897, U01 HL089856]; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [R01HL137995] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) R01 HL152735 and R01 HL137995.

From enhanced sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization data of brain, cell clustering for spatial transcriptomics finds functional cell subtypes with different micro-environments, which are all validated experimentally, inspiring biological hypotheses about the underlying interactions among the cell state, cell type and micro-environment.","[Li, Jiachen; Pan, Xiaoyong; Yuan, Ye; Shen, Hong-Bin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Image Proc & Pattern Recognit, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiachen; Pan, Xiaoyong; Yuan, Ye; Shen, Hong-Bin] Minist Educ China, Key Lab Syst Control & Informat Proc, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Siheng; Yuan, Ye; Shen, Hong-Bin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Cooperat Medianet Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Siheng; Yuan, Ye; Shen, Hong-Bin] Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Yuan, Y; Shen, HB (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Image Proc & Pattern Recognit, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Yuan, Y; Shen, HB (corresponding author), Minist Educ China, Key Lab Syst Control & Informat Proc, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Yuan, Y; Shen, HB (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Cooperat Medianet Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Yuan, Y; Shen, HB (corresponding author), Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",yuanye_auto@sjtu.edu.cn,"Luo, F/AAF-5708-2019; zhang, yuyang/IVV-5089-2023; Li, Jiachen/KJM-5418-2024","Li, Jiachen/0000-0001-9137-6262; Pan, Xiaoyong/0000-0001-5010-464X; yuan, ye/0000-0002-4270-8002","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61725302, 62073219, 62103262, 61903248]; Shanghai Pujiang Programme [21PJ1407700]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Programme(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 61725302 to H.S.), 62073219 (to H.S.), 62103262 (to Y.Y.) and 61903248 (to X.P.) and the Shanghai Pujiang Programme (no. 21PJ1407700 to Y.Y.).",,50,49,49,20,57,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-8457,,NAT COMPUT SCI,Nat.

Therefore, determining comorbid diseases would significantly affect the treatment of cancer patients. Because cancer disease is very complex, we can represent the relationship between cancer and its comorbidities as a network. Furthermore, the network analysis can be employed to determine comorbidities as a community detection problem because the relationship between cancer and its comorbidities forms a community. This study investigates which community detection algorithms are more appropriate to determine the comorbid of cancer. Given different community findings, this study attempted to analyze the modularity generated by the algorithm to decide the significant comorbid diseases. We retrieved lung cancer comorbid data on the basis of text mining manuscripts in PubMed, searched through disease ontologies, and calculated disease similarity. We investigate 20 algorithms using five modularity metrics and 16 fitness function evaluations to determine the significant comorbid diseases. The results show the five best modularity algorithms, namely label propagation, spinglass, Chinese whispers, Louvain, RB Pots. These five algorithms found significant comorbidities: blood vessels, immune system, bone, pancreas, and metabolic disorders, atrial cardiac septal defect, atrial fibrillation respiratory system, interstitial lung, and diabetes mellitus. The fitness function justifies the results of the community algorithm, and the ones that have a significant effect are average internal degree, size, and edges inside. This study contributes to more comprehensive knowledge and management of diseases in the healthcare context.","[Rustamaji, Heru C.; Suharini, Yustina S.; Permana, Angga A.; Kusuma, Wisnu A.] IPB Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Bogor, Indonesia; [Nurdiati, Sri] IPB Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Math, Bogor, Indonesia; [Batubara, Irmanida] IPB Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Bogor, Indonesia; [Kusuma, Wisnu A.; Batubara, Irmanida] IPB Univ, Trop Biopharmaca Res Ctr, Bogor, Indonesia; [Djatna, Taufik] IPB Univ, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Agroind Technol, Bogor, Indonesia; [Rustamaji, Heru C.] UPN Vet Yogyakarta, Fac Ind Technol, Dept Informat, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Suharini, Yustina S.] Inst Teknol Indonesia, Dept Informat Engn, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia; [Permana, Angga A.] Univ Multimedia Nusantara, Fac Engn & Informat, Dept Informat, Tangerang, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Multimedia Nusantara University,"Kusuma, WA (corresponding author), IPB Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Bogor, Indonesia.",ananta@apps.ipb.ac.id,"Rustamaji, Heru Cahya/GOE-3883-2022; Batubara, Irmanida/AAB-7126-2021; Djatna, Taufik/AAM-9608-2020; Kusuma, Wisnu Ananta/ABB-9117-2020; Suharini, Yustina Sri/GON-6738-2022","Rustamaji, Heru Cahya/0000-0001-8283-863X; Batubara, Irmanida/0000-0001-8201-7807; Djatna, Taufik/0000-0002-2071-089X; Kusuma, Wisnu Ananta/0000-0002-3682-244X; Aditya Permana, Angga/0009-0001-4948-5630",,,,,84,5,5,0,4,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2364-8228,,APPL NETW SCI,Appl.

We report that the hallmarks of tumor recognition in ovarian cancer-infiltrating T cells are primarily restricted to tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells. Single-cell RNA/TCR/ATAC sequencing of 83,454 CD3(+) CD8(+)CD103(+)CD69(+) TRM cells and immunohistochemistry of 122 high-grade serous ovarian cancers shows that only progenitor (TCF1(low)) tissue-resident T cells (TRMstem cells), but not recirculating TCF1(+) T cells, predict ovarian cancer outcome. TRMstem cells arise from transitional recirculating T cells, which depends on antigen affinity/persistence, resulting in oligoclonal, trogocytic, effector lymphocytes that eventually become exhausted. Therefore, ovarian cancer is indeed an immunogenic disease, but that depends on similar to 13% of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating T cells (similar to 3% of CD8(+) clonotypes), which are primed against high-affinity antigens and maintain waves of effector TRM-like cells. Our results define the signature of relevant tumor-reactive T cells in human ovarian cancer, which could be applicable to other tumors with unideal mutational burden.","[Anadon, Carmen M.; Hanggi, Kay; Biswas, Subir; Chaurio, Ricardo A.; Payne, Kyle K.; Mandal, Gunjan; Innamarato, Patrick; Harro, Carly M.; Mine, Jessica A.; Sprenger, Kimberly B.; Cortina, Carla; Powers, John J.; Costich, Tara Lee; Rodriguez, Paulo C.; Conejo-Garcia, Jose R.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Immunol, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Yu, Xiaoqing] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Martin, Alexandra; Conejo-Garcia, Jose R.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Gynecol Oncol, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Perez, Bradford A.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Radiat Therapy, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Gatenbee, Chandler D.; Prabhakaran, Sandhya] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Math Oncol, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Marchion, Douglas] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Tissue Core, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Heemskerk, Mirjam H.

The latest advances in scRNA-seq technology have made it possible to profile tens of thousands of individual cells simultaneously. However, the technology also increases the number of missing values, i. e, dropouts, from technical constraints, such as amplification failure during the reverse transcription step. The resulting sparsity of scRNA-seq count data can be very high, with greater than 90% of data entries being zeros, which becomes an obstacle for clustering cell types. Current imputation methods are not robust in the case of high sparsity. In this study, we develop a Neural Network-based Imputation for scRNA-seq count data, NISC. It uses autoencoder, coupled with a weighted loss function and regularization, to correct the dropouts in scRNA-seq count data. A systematic evaluation shows that NISC is an effective imputation approach for handling sparse scRNA-seq count data, and its performance surpasses existing imputation methods in cell type identification.","[Zhang, Xiang; Chen, Zhuo; Bhadani, Rahul; Lu, Meng; Lytal, Nicholas; An, Lingling] Univ Arizona, Interdisciplinary Program Stat & Data Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Zhang, Xiang; An, Lingling] Univ Arizona, Dept Biosyst Engn, Tucson, AZ USA; [Bhadani, Rahul; Cao, Siyang] Univ Arizona, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tucson, AZ USA; [Lytal, Nicholas] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Math & Stat, Chico, CA USA; [Chen, Yin] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Tucson, AZ USA; [An, Lingling] Univ Arizona, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; California State University System; California State University Chico; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"An, LL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Interdisciplinary Program Stat & Data Sci, Tucson, AZ USA.;An, LL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Biosyst Engn, Tucson, AZ USA.;An, LL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Tucson, AZ USA.",anling@email.arizona.edu,"cao, siyang/JEP-0039-2023; Bhadani, Rahul/AAN-2905-2020; Lu, Meng/JVO-3171-2024","cao, siyang/0000-0001-9593-265X; Bhadani, Rahul/0000-0002-7403-6458;","National Institute of Health [1R01GM139829-01, 1P01AI148104-01A1, U19AG065169, 5P01AG052359-05, R01ES027013, ARZT-1361620-H22-149]; United States Department of Agriculture [R01AI149754]",National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),This work has been partially supported by the National Institute of Health (1R01GM139829-01; 1P01AI148104-01A1; U19AG065169; 5P01AG052359-05) and the United States Department of Agriculture (ARZT-1361620-H22-149) to LA and by the National Institute of Health (R01AI149754 and R01ES027013) to YC.,,57,4,5,1,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

An important task in these systems is to extract a simplified view of their time-dependent network of interactions. Community detection in temporal networks usually relies on aggregation over time windows or consider sequences of different stationary epochs. For dynamics-based methods, attempts to generalize static-network methodologies also face the fundamental difficulty that a stationary state of the dynamics does not always exist. Here, we derive a method based on a dynamical process evolving on the temporal network. Our method allows dynamics that do not reach a steady state and uncovers two sets of communities for a given time interval that accounts for the ordering of edges in forward and backward time. We show that our method provides a natural way to disentangle the different dynamical scales present in a system with synthetic and real-world examples.","[Bovet, Alexandre; Lambiotte, Renaud] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England; [Bovet, Alexandre; Delvenne, Jean-Charles] Catholic Univ Louvain, ICTEAM, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Delvenne, Jean-Charles] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Oxford; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Bovet, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England.;Bovet, A (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, ICTEAM, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",alexandre.bovet@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Delvenne, Jean-Charles/F-5902-2011; Bovet, Alexandre/H-6413-2013; Lambiotte, Renaud/HDO-4530-2022","Bovet, Alexandre/0000-0003-3937-3704; Lambiotte, Renaud/0000-0002-0583-4595",Swiss National Science Foundation [P300P2_177793]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P300P2_177793] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),A.B. thanks the Swiss National Science Foundation for the financial support (grant P300P2_177793).,,62,4,4,6,31,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

This study aims to delin-eate and characterize the cancer service areas (CSA) accounting for the presence of major cancer centers in the United States. We used the Medi-care enrollment and claims from January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015 to build a spatial network from patients with cancer to cancer care facil-ities that provided inpatient and outpatient care of cancer-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. After excluding those without clinical care or outside of the United States, we identified 94 NCI-designated and other academic cancer centers from the members of the Association of American Cancer Institutes. By explicitly incorporating existing specialized cancer referral centers, we refined the spatially constrained Leiden method that accounted for spatial adjacency and other constraints to delineate coherent CSAs within which the service volumes were maximal but minimal be-tween them. The derived 110 CSAs had a high mean localization index (LI; 0.83) with a narrow variability (SD = 0.10). The variation of LI across the CSAs was positively associated with population, median household income, and area size, and negatively with travel time. Averagely, patients traveled less and were more likely to receive cancer care within the CSAs anchored by cancer centers than their counterparts without cancer centers. We con-cluded that CSAs are effective in capturing the local cancer care markets in the United States. They can be used as reliable units for studying cancer care and informing more evidence-based policy.Significance: Using the most refined network community detection method, we can delineate CSAs in a more robust, systematic, and empirical manner that incorporates existing specialized cancer referral centers. The CSAs can be used as a reliable unit for studying cancer care and informing more evidence-based policy in the United States. The cross-walk tabula-tion of ZIP code areas, CSAs, and related programs for CSAs delineation are disseminated for public access.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Onega, Tracy] Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Onega, Tracy] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biomed Data Sci, 1 Med Ctr Dr,HB 7927,Rubin,8th Floor, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute; Dartmouth College,"Onega, T (corresponding author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biomed Data Sci, 1 Med Ctr Dr,HB 7927,Rubin,8th Floor, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA.",tracy.onega@hci.utah.edu,,"Onega, Tracy/0000-0002-1633-3040; Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",NCI [R21CA212687],NCI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"Acknowledgments This work receives financial support from the NCI (R21CA212687, T.

The contradictions between the goals and the concrete plans to increase production, processing, and consumption of forest biomass in Europe have however raised sustainability concerns within and beyond its borders. While political actors articulate such contradictions differently and compete for traction for their viewpoints in the public discourse, little is known about how citizens of urban areas perceive this discourse. Conceptualising perception as a multidimensional construct, data from eight European university cities (Bordeaux, Bratislava, Freiburg, Helsinki, Padua, St. Petersburg, Uppsala, Vienna) are statistically analysed to explore its dimensions, the communities of like-minded citizens forming across those dimensions, and the traits associating with membership in each such community. Five communities across six dimensions from biocentrism through distributional aspects to adherence to political goals are identified: adherent-environmentalist, adherent-governmentalist, critical-reformist, critical -agriculturalist, and indifferent. City of residence and perceived familiarity with bioeconomy clearly interact with perception. There is however considerable variation in communities within and across the eight cities, suggesting deeper social tension beyond the public discourse. Much of the within-community variation remains unexplained, though, calling for more work locally. Implications for forest policy are derived.","[Malkamaki, Arttu] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Korhonen, Jaana E.; Berghall, Sami; D'Amato, Dalia; Suomala, Tuuli; Toppinen, Anne; Valsta, Lauri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Malkamaki, Arttu; Korhonen, Jaana E.; D'Amato, Dalia; Toppinen, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Rustas, Carolina Berg; Mark-Herbert, Cecilia; Nagy, Emil] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Berno, Hanna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Carreira, Ariane] French Natl Inst Environm Res & Technol, Bordeaux, France; [Dobrovolsky, Alexander] St Petersburg State Forest Tech Univ, Dept Forestry, St Petersburg, Russia; [Giertliova, Blanka; Navratilova, Lenka; Vybostok, Jozef] Dept Econ & Management Forestry, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Holmgren, Sara] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden; [Masiero, Mauro; Secco, Laura] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy; [Puelzl, Helga] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Puelzl, Helga] European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Ranather, Lea] Wood K plus Competence Ctr Wood Composites & Wood, Linz, Austria; [Zellweger, Jonas] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany; [Korhonen, Jaana E.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Padua; BOKU University; University of Freiburg; Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education,"Malkamaki, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Malkamaki, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",arttu.malkamaki@helsinki.fi; jaana.e.korhonen@helsinki.fi; sami.berghall@helsinki.fi; hanna.berno@edu.se; ariane.carreira@irstea.fr; dalia.damato@helsinki.fi; blanka.giertliova@tuzvo.sk; holmgren@slu.se; sara.holmgren@slu.se; cecilia.mark-herbert@slu.se; mauro.masiero@unipd.it; emil.nagy@slu.se; lenka.navratilova@tuzvo.sk; helga.puelzl@boku.ac.at; l.ranacher@wood-kplus.at; laura.secco@unipd.it; anne.toppinen@helsinki.fi; lauri.valsta@helsinki.fi; jozef.vybostok@tuzvo.sk; jonas.zellweger@jupiter.uni-freiburg.de,"Masiero, Mauro/G-5186-2015; Marcinekov√°, Lenka/ABH-1268-2020; Secco, Laura/B-6304-2012","Masiero, Mauro/0000-0001-5660-4362; Marcinekov√°, Lenka/0000-0003-2989-336X; Malkamaki, Arttu/0000-0002-7751-8831; Puelzl, Helga/0000-0001-7920-5903; Korhonen, Jaana/0000-0001-9266-2260; D'Amato, Dalia/0000-0002-3992-7263; Toppinen, Anne/0000-0003-0910-1505; Giertliova, Blanka/0000-0001-8794-9347; Mark-Herbert, Cecilia/0000-0001-7440-9106; Valsta, Lauri/0000-0002-7555-7271",Euro-pean Forest Institute (EFI); Kone Foundation [201805496]; FORMAS - the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development [942-2016-30]; FFG - the Austrian Research Promotion Agency [865905]; Strategic Research Council [335241],Euro-pean Forest Institute (EFI); Kone Foundation; FORMAS - the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; FFG - the Austrian Research Promotion Agency; Strategic Research Council,"We want to express our sincere gratitude to everybody who took part in the survey in one of the eight cities.

Large studies of brain community structure often include images acquired on multiple scanners across different studies. Differences in scanner can introduce variability into the downstream results, and these differences are often referred to as scanner effects. Such effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common network metrics. In this study, we identify scanner effects in data-driven community detection results and related network metrics. We assess a commonly employed harmonization method and propose new methodology for harmonizing functional connectivity that leverage existing knowledge about network structure as well as patterns of covariance in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that our new methods reduce scanner effects in community structure and network metrics. Our results highlight scanner effects in studies of brain functional organization and provide additional tools to address these unwanted effects. These findings and methods can be incorporated into future functional connectivity studies, potentially preventing spurious findings and improving reliability of results.","[Chen, Andrew A.; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen, Andrew A.; Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Ctr Biomed Image Comp & Analyt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos] Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pomponio, Raymond] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Resnick, Susan M.; Beason-Held, Lori L.] NIA, Lab Behav Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Penn Lifespan Informat & Neuroimaging Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Nuerol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Colorado School of Public Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; The Santa Fe Institute,"Chen, AA (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",andrewac@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,"Fan, Yong/O-4412-2014; Nasrallah, Ilya/KHW-9095-2024; Satterthwaite, Theodore/N-4804-2017","Fan, Yong/0000-0001-9869-4685; Satterthwaite, Theodore/0000-0001-7072-9399; Chen, Andrew/0000-0002-5027-6422; Nasrallah, Ilya/0000-0003-2346-7562; Pomponio, Raymond/0000-0003-0434-4751","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01 NS085211, R01 NS060910]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG-170728586]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, R01EB022573]; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409]; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01EB022573]; University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (Grant numbers R01 NS085211 and R01 NS060910), the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG-170728586), the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, and R01EB022573), the National Institute on Aging (RF1AG054409), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (R01EB022573), and a seed grant from the University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA).

Utilizing a novel method called multi-view modularity clustering (MVMC), we identify groups of accounts engaged in distinct narrative and network information maneuvers. We then present an analytical pipeline to holistically determine their coordinated and complementary roles within the broader digital campaign. Applying our proposed methodology to disclosed Chinese state-sponsored accounts on Twitter, we discover an overarching operation to protect and manage Chinese international reputation by attacking individual adversaries (Guo Wengui) and collective threats (Hong Kong protestors), while also projecting national strength during global crisis (the COVID-19 pandemic). Psycholinguistic tools quantify variation in narrative maneuvers employing hateful and negative language against critics in contrast to communitarian and positive language to bolster national solidarity. Network analytics further distinguish how groups of accounts used network maneuvers to act as balanced operators, organized masqueraders, and egalitarian echo-chambers. Collectively, this work breaks methodological ground on the interdisciplinary application of unsupervised and multi-view methods for characterizing not just digital campaigns in particular, but also coordinated activity more generally. Moreover, our findings contribute substantive empirical insights around how state-sponsored information operations combine narrative and network maneuvers to achieve interlocking strategic objectives. This bears both theoretical and policy implications for platform regulation and understanding the evolving geopolitical significance of cyberspace.","[Uyheng, Joshua; Cruickshank, Iain J.; Carley, Kathleen M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, CASOS Ctr, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Uyheng, J (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, CASOS Ctr, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",juyheng@cs.cmu.edu,,,"Knight Foundation; Office of Naval Research [N000141812106, N000141812108]; Omar N.

However, the datasets generated from these technologies tend to have high levels of noise, making data analysis challenging. Here, we propose jointly semi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (JSNMF), which is a versatile toolkit for the integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data profiled from the same cell. JSNMF enables data visualization and clustering of the cells and also facilitates downstream analysis, including the characterization of markers and functional pathway enrichment analysis. The core of JSNMF is an unsupervised method based on JSNMF, where it assumes different latent variables for the two molecular modalities, and integrates the information of transcriptomic and epigenomic data with consensus graph fusion, which better tackles the distinct characteristics and levels of noise across different molecular modalities in single-cell multiomics data. We applied JSNMF to single-cell multiomics datasets from different tissues and different technologies. The results demonstrate the superior performance of JSNMF in clustering and data visualization of the cells. JSNMF also allows joint analysis of multiple single-cell multiomics experiments and single-cell multiomics data with more than two modalities profiled on the same cell. JSNMF also provides rich biological insight on the markers, cell-type-specific region-gene associations and the functions of the identified cell subpopulation.","[Ma, Yuanyuan; Sun, Zexuan; Zeng, Pengcheng; Zhang, Wenyu; Lin, Zhixiang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yuanyuan] Anyang Normal Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Anyang, Henan, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Anyang Normal University,"Lin, ZX (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zhixianglin@cuhk.edu.hk,"ma, yuanyuan/KFT-2361-2024; Lin, Zhixiang/AEK-1516-2022; Zhang, Wenyu/IWD-8396-2023","Lin, Zhixiang/0000-0001-9301-947X; Zhang, Wenyu/0009-0001-4576-8801","Chinese University of Hong Kong direct grants [4053423, 4053476]; Chinese University of Hong Kong start up grant [4930181]; Chinese University of Hong Kong's Project Impact Enhancement Fund (PIEF); Science Faculty's Collaborative Research Impact Matching Scheme (CRIMS); Hong Kong Research Grant Council [ECS 24301419, GRF 14301120]",Chinese University of Hong Kong direct grants; Chinese University of Hong Kong start up grant; Chinese University of Hong Kong's Project Impact Enhancement Fund (PIEF); Science Faculty's Collaborative Research Impact Matching Scheme (CRIMS); Hong Kong Research Grant Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"The Chinese University of Hong Kong direct grants (4053423,4053476); The Chinese University of Hong Kong start up grant (4930181); The Chinese University of Hong Kong's Project Impact Enhancement Fund (PIEF) and Science Faculty's Collaborative Research Impact Matching Scheme (CRIMS); Hong Kong Research Grant Council (ECS 24301419, GRF 14301120).",,51,10,10,6,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1467-5463,1477-4054,,BRIEF BIOINFORM,Brief.

However, many studies question the replicability and reliability of the Dartmouth HSAs in meeting the challenges of an ever-changing and a diverse set of health care services. This research develops a reproducible, automated, and efficient GIS tool to implement Dartmouth method for defining HSAs. Moreover, the research adapts two popular network community detection methods to account for spatial constraints for defining HSAs that are scale flexible and optimize an important property such as maximum service flows within HSAs. A case study based on the state inpatient database in Florida from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project is used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods. The study represents a major step towards developing HSA delineation methods that are computationally efficient, adaptable for various scales (from a local region to as large as a national market) and automated without a steep learning curve for public health professionals.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,,"Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",National Cancer Institute; [R21CA212687],National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI));,This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute [R21CA212687].,,39,12,14,4,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5683,1947-5691,,ANN GIS,Ann.

The disconnected picture of macrophage biology that has emerged from these observations is a barrier for integration across models or with in vitro macrophage activation paradigms. We set out to contextualize macrophage heterogeneity across mouse tissues and inflammatory conditions, specifically aiming to define a common framework of macrophage activation. We built a predictive model with which we mapped the activation of macrophages across 12 tissues and 25 biological conditions, finding a notable commonality and finite number of transcriptional profiles, in particular among infiltrating macrophages, which we modeled as defined stages along four conserved activation paths. These activation paths include a phagocytic regulatory path, an inflammatory cytokine-producing path, an oxidative stress antimicrobial path, or a remodeling extracellular matrix deposition path. We verified this model with adoptive cell transfer experiments and identified transient RELM. expression as a feature of monocyte-derived macrophage tissue engraftment. We propose that this integrative approach of macrophage classification allows the establishment of a common predictive framework of monocyte-derived macrophage activation in inflammation and homeostasis.","[Sanin, David E.;

Most studies to date have only focused on the effect of specific disorders on infection severity, without considering that patients usually present multiple chronic diseases and that these conditions tend to group together in the form of multimorbidity patterns. In this large-scale epidemiological study, including primary and hospital care information of 166,242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from the Spanish region of Andalusia, we applied network analysis to identify multimorbidity profiles and analyze their impact on the risk of hospitalization and mortality. Our results showed that multimorbidity was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and that this risk increased with the morbidity burden. Individuals with advanced cardio-metabolic profiles frequently presented the highest infection severity risk in both sexes. The pattern with the highest severity associated in men was present in almost 28.7% of those aged >= 80 years and included associations between cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases; age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (1.71 (1.44-2.02)). In women, similar patterns were also associated the most with infection severity, in 7% of 65-79-year-olds (1.44 (1.34-1.54)) and in 29% of >= 80-year-olds (1.35 (1.18-1.53)). Patients with mental health patterns also showed one of the highest risks of COVID-19 severity, especially in women. These findings strongly recommend the implementation of personalized approaches to patients with multimorbidity and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the population with high morbidity burden.","[Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas] Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, WHO Collaborating Ctr Drug Stat Methodol, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Drug Stat, Div Hlth Data & Digitalisat, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca] Spanish Soc Family & Community Med SEMFYC, Drug Utilizat Work Grp, Barcelona 08009, Spain; [Munoyerro-Muniz, Dolores; Rodriguez-Herrera, Juliana; Antonio Goicoechea-Salazar, Juan; Villegas-Portero, Roman] Serv Andaluz Salud SAS, Subdirecc Tecn Asesora Gest Informac, Seville 41071, Spain",Miguel Servet University Hospital; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Carmona-P√≠rez, J (corresponding author), Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-P√≠rez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Carmona-P√≠rez, J (corresponding author), Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-P√≠rez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain.",jcarmona@iisaragon.es; ignatios.ioakeimskoufa@fhi.no; agimenomi.iacs@aragon.es; bpoblador.iacs@aragon.es; franciscagonzalezrubio@gmail.com; dolores.munoyerro.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; juliana.rodriguez.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; jantonio.goicoechea@juntadeandalucia.es; sprados.iacs@aragon.es; romanp.villegas@juntadeandalucia.es,"Carmona Pirez, Jonas/AAE-8594-2022; Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/AAX-4807-2020; Villegas, Roman/J-9159-2016; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/GPT-3556-2022; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/P-5818-2017","Carmona Pirez, Jonas/0000-0002-6268-8803; Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/0000-0002-6518-749X; Villegas, Roman/0000-0003-0845-0172; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/0000-0001-5939-4436; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio/0000-0002-5440-1710; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz/0000-0002-5119-5093; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/0000-0002-5704-6056","Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Gobierno de Aragon [B01_20R, DECRETO-LEY 3/2020]; European Union-NextGenerationEU",Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon; Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Gobierno de Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Union-NextGenerationEU,"This work was cofunded by Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon and Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Rio Hortega Program, grant number CM19/00164; RICAPPS, grant number RD21/0016/0019), Gobierno de Aragon (Grant numbers B01_20R and DECRETO-LEY 3/2020, de 3 de junio, del Gobierno de Aragon) and the European Union-NextGenerationEU.",,58,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

We used transcriptome data from PD patients with Braak stage information to understand underlying molecular mechanisms for the progress of the disease. We created networks of genes with continuously decreased/increased co-expression from control group to Braak 5-6 stages. These networks are significantly associated with PD-related mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic signalling among others. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm to the co-expression networks led to more specific modules enriched with neurodegeneration-related disease pathways, seizure, abnormality of coordination, and hypotonia. Furthermore, we showed that one of the co-expression networks is clustered into three major communities with dedicated molecular functions: (i) tubulin folding pathway, gap junction-related mechanisms, neuronal system; (ii) synaptic vesicle, intracellular vesicle, proteasome complex, PD genes; (iii) energy metabolism, mitochondrial mechanisms, oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, PD genes. The co-expression relations we identified in this study as crucial players in the disease progression cover several known PD-associated genes and genes whose products are known to physically interact with alpha-synuclein protein.","[Duz, Elif; Cakir, Tunahan] Gebze Tech Univ, Dept Bioengn, TR-41400 Kocaeli, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"√áakir, T (corresponding author), Gebze Tech Univ, Dept Bioengn, TR-41400 Kocaeli, Turkey.",,"Cakir, Tunahan/F-4523-2011","Cakir, Tunahan/0000-0001-8262-4420; Duz, Elif/0000-0001-7702-0868",,,,,57,2,2,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

While current approaches are successful in reducing the number of sequence alignments performed, the generated clusters are based on a single sequence identity threshold applied to every cluster. Poor choices of this identity threshold would thus lead to low quality clusters. There is however little support provided to users in selecting thresholds that are well matched with the input sequences. Results We present a novel sequence clustering approach called ALFATClust that exploits rapid pairwise alignment-free sequence distance calculations and community detection in graph for clusters generation. Instead of a single threshold applied to every generated cluster, ALFATClust is capable of dynamically determining the cut-off threshold for each individual cluster by considering both cluster separation and intra-cluster sequence similarity. Benchmarking analysis shows that ALFATClust generally outperforms existing approaches by simultaneously maintaining cluster robustness and substantial cluster separation for the benchmark datasets. The software also provides an evaluation report for verifying the quality of the non-singleton clusters obtained. Conclusions ALFATClust is able to generate sequence clusters having high intra-cluster sequence similarity and substantial separation between clusters without having users to decide precise similarity cut-off thresholds.","[Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore; [Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore.;Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",ephoth@nus.edu.sg,,,"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore [SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04]","Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","This research is supported by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore under its Infectious Disease Programme Research (SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04).",,43,5,6,0,19,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,MAR 30,2022,23.0,1,,,,,,,108,10.1186/s12859-022-04643-9,0.0,,,20,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,0D5HH,35354426.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000776025700002,0

We therefore developed a computation method, Dimension-Reduction Spatial-Clustering (DR-SC), that can simultaneously perform dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering within a unified framework. Joint analysis by DR-SC produces accurate (spatial) clustering results and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative low-dimensional features. DR-SC is applicable to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics that characterizes the spatial organization of the tissue by segregating it into multiple tissue structures. Here, DR-SC relies on a latent hidden Markov random field model to encourage the spatial smoothness of the detected spatial cluster boundaries. Underlying DR-SC is an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode. As such, DR-SC is scalable to large sample sizes and can optimize the spatial smoothness parameter in a data-driven manner. With comprehensive simulations and real data applications, we show that DR-SC outperforms existing clustering and spatial clustering methods: it extracts more biologically relevant features than conventional dimension reduction methods, improves clustering performance, and offers improved trajectory inference and visualization for downstream trajectory inference analyses.","[Liu, Wei; Shi, Xingjie] East China Normal Univ, Acad Stat & Interdisciplinary Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wei; Liao, Xu; Yang, Yi; Liu, Jin] Duke NUS Med Sch, Ctr Quantitat Med, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Singapore 169857, Singapore; [Lin, Huazhen] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Stat Res, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Lin, Huazhen] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Yeong, Joe] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol IMCB, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Yeong, Joe] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Anat Pathol, Singapore 169856, Singapore; [Zhou, Xiang] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Shi, Xingjie] East China Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Key Lab Adv Theory & Applicat Stat & Data Sci MOE, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; National University of Singapore; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Molecular & Cell Biology (IMCB); Singapore General Hospital; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; East China Normal University,"Shi, XJ (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Acad Stat & Interdisciplinary Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Liu, J (corresponding author), Duke NUS Med Sch, Ctr Quantitat Med, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Singapore 169857, Singapore.;Zhou, X (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Shi, XJ (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Key Lab Adv Theory & Applicat Stat & Data Sci MOE, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",xzhousph@umich.edu; xjshi@fem.ecnu.edu.cn; jin.liu@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Liu, Jianjun/AAK-4989-2020; Wei, Liu/HJI-1476-2023; Shi, Xingjie/B-7822-2018","Liu, Jianjun/0000-0002-3255-3019; Wei, Liu/0000-0002-1259-6564; Liu, Jin/0000-0002-5707-2078; LIAO, XU/0000-0003-1851-4395; Shi, Xingjie/0000-0002-9866-8599","Ministry of Education, Singapore [MOET2EP20220-0009, MOE2018-T2-2-006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSF: 11931014, NSF: 12171229]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [22ZR1420500]","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai)","This work was supported by grant AcRF Tier 2 (MOET2EP20220-0009 and MOE2018-T2-2-006) from the Ministry of Education, Singapore, grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF: 11931014 and NSF: 12171229), and grant 22ZR1420500 from Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai.

Single-cell sequencing technology provides substantial prospects to gain an in-depth understanding of the cellular phenotypic variability driving tumor progression. A comprehensive insight into the intra-tumor heterogeneity may further assist in dealing with the treatment-resistant clones in cancer patients, thereby improving their overall survival. However, this task is hampered due to the challenges associated with the single-cell data, such as false positives, false negatives and missing bases, and the increase in their size. As a result, the computational cost of the existing methods increases, thereby limiting their usage. In this work, we propose a robust graph learning-based method, ARCANE-ROG (Algorithm for Reconstruction of CANcer Evolution via RObust Graph learning), for inferring clonal evolution from single-cell datasets. The first step of the proposed method is a joint framework of denoising with data imputation for the noisy and incomplete matrix while simultaneously learning an adjacency graph. Both the operations in the joint framework boost each other such that the overall performance of the denoising algorithm is improved. In the second step, an optimal number of clusters are identified via the Leiden method. In the last step, clonal evolution trees are inferred via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The method has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, RobustClone, using simulated datasets of varying sizes and five real datasets. The performance of our proposed method is found to be significantly superior (p-value < 0.05) in terms of reconstruction error, False Positive to False Negative (FPFN) ratio, tree distance error and V-measure compared to the other method. Overall, the proposed method is an improvement over the existing methods as it enhances cluster assignment and inference on clonal hierarchies.","[Farswan, Akanksha; Gupta, Anubha] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Dept ECE, SBILab, New Delhi, India; [Gupta, Ritu] AIIMS, Dr BRA IRCH, Lab Oncol Unit, New Delhi, India",Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; DR.

By mining the semantic and syntactic information of citations, the new approach considers more diverse dimensions as the basis of author bibliographic coupling strength.

However, there is still lack of tools that could integrate these unlimited accumulations of single-cell expression data. Here, we presented a universal approach iSEEEK for integrating super large-scale single-cell expression via exploring expression rankings of top-expressing genes. We developed iSEEEK with 11.9 million single cells. We demonstrated the efficiency of iSEEEK with canonical single-cell downstream tasks on five heterogenous datasets encompassing human and mouse samples. iSEEEK achieved good clustering performance benchmarked against well-annotated cell labels. In addition, iSEEEK could transfer its knowledge learned from large-scale expression data on new dataset that was not involved in its development. iSEEEK enables identification of gene-gene interaction networks that are characteristic of specific cell types. Our study presents a simple and yet effective method to integrate super large-scale single-cell transcriptomes and would facilitate translational single-cell research from bench to bedside.","[Wu, Dan; Zhang, Chao; Yang, Yichen; Yang, Meng; Wang, Wei; Li, Yang; Zhang, Qiang; Yang, Jilong; Chen, Kexin; Li, Xiangchun] Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Shen, Hongru; Shen, Xilin; Feng, Mengyao; Hu, Jiani; Liu, Jilei] Tianjin Med Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin Medical University; Tianjin Medical University,"Li, XC (corresponding author), Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Tianjin Canc Inst, Huanhu Xi Rd, Tianjin 300060, Peoples R China.;Chen, KX (corresponding author), Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Huanhu Xi Rd, Tianjin 300060, Peoples R China.",shenhongru@tmu.edu.cn; shenxilin2019@tmu.edu.cn; fengmengyao2019@tmu.edu.cn; wudan0729@tmu.edu.cn; zhangchao_tjmu@163.com; yang_yichen@tmu.edu.cn; yangmeng_yx@sina.com; tmuhjn0508@163.com; liujilei156231@outlook.com; nbu_wangwei@126.com; liyang_nk@163.com; zhangqiang@tjmuch.com; yangjilong@tjmuch.com; chenkexin@tmu.edu.cn; lixiangchun2014@foxmail.com,"DOU, LIPING/KAL-7005-2024; Yang, Yichen/JHT-4368-2023; TIAN, YI/KHU-9704-2024; Chen, Kexin/ISV-0772-2023; Feng, Mengyao/GSM-7996-2022; Wang, Zejun/KBB-8454-2024; Yang, Jilong/AAF-7236-2019","Yang, Yichen/0000-0002-3365-7178; Yang, Jilong/0000-0001-5162-3740; Li, Xiangchun/0000-0002-2230-2152; Chen, Kexin/0000-0003-4248-7681","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31801117, 31900471, 82073287]; Tianjin Municipal Health Commission Foundation [RC20027, IRT_14R40]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University in China",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tianjin Municipal Health Commission Foundation; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University in China(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31801117 to X.L., 31900471 to M.Y. and 82073287 to Q.Z.); Tianjin Municipal Health Commission Foundation (grant no.

Measures are a function of a network's structure and a given partition. Previous approaches extend classical centrality measures to account for community structure with little connection to community detection theory. In contrast, we propose cluster-quality vitality measures, i.e., modularity vitality, a community-aware measure which is well-grounded in both centrality and community detection theory. Modularity vitality quantifies positive and negative contributions to community structure, which indicate a node's role as a community bridge or hub. We derive a computationally efficient method of calculating modularity vitality for all nodes in O(M + NC) time, where C is the number of communities. We systematically fragment networks by removing central nodes, and find that modularity vitality consistently outperforms existing community-aware centrality measures. We show measures well-grounded in community theory are over 8 times more effective on a million-node infrastructure network. This result does not generalize to social media communication networks, which exhibit extreme robustness to all community-aware centrality attacks. This robustness suggests that user-based interventions to mitigate misinformation diffusion will be ineffective. Finally, we demonstrate that modularity vitality provides a new approach to community-deception.","[Magelinski, Thomas; Bartulovic, Mihovil; Carley, Kathleen M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Magelinski, T (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA.",tmagelin@andrew.cmu.edu; mbartulo@andrew.cmu.edu; kathleen.carley@cs.cmu.edu,,"Carley, Kathleen M./0000-0002-6356-0238; Magelinski, Thomas/0000-0002-6369-0753","Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N000141512797, N000141712675]; Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organization Systems (CASOS); ARCS Foundation scholarship; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) [N000141512797, N000141712675] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)",Office of Naval Research (ONR)(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organization Systems (CASOS); ARCS Foundation scholarship; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)(United States Department of Defense),"This work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Award N000141512797 Minerva Award for Dynamic Statistical Network Informatics, ONR Award N000141712675, and the Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organization Systems (CASOS).

One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the mbkmeans package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells.

In this work, we advocate for the development of hybrid methods that are built on top of the frameworks of existing state-of-art heuristics, thereby improving these methods. We demonstrate this by building on the so called Louvain method, which is one of the most popular algorithms for the Community detection problem and develop and Ising-based Louvain method.

To correctly predict routing congestion, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) has gained great attention. However, existing GNN-based methods have limitations in capturing crucial netlist information and effectively representing complex topologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach, ClusterNet, to predict routing congestion caused by netlist topology. Our approach leverages netlist clustering to overcome these limitations. We first divide the netlist into highly connected clusters using the Leiden algorithm, enabling an analysis of the local netlist topology. We then predict routing congestion by exploiting GNNs to generate cluster embeddings that capture the detailed netlist topology. In addition, we introduce a cluster padding method that utilizes the trained model to mitigate routing congestion. By applying the proposed ClusterNet, we can accurately predict and optimize routing congestion from specific cluster topologies. Our experimental results demonstrated improved prediction performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.056 and an R2 score of 0.669. Furthermore, routing congestion optimization significantly improved the total negative slack and reduced the number of failing endpoints by 14.5% and 9.9%, respectively.","[Min, Kyungjun; Kwon, Seongbin; Lee, Sung-Yun; Kim, Dohun; Park, Sunghye; Kang, Seokhyeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Min, K (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",kj.min@postech.ac.kr; sbkwon@postech.ac.kr; syun.lee@postech.ac.kr; dohunkim@postech.ac.kr; shpark96@postech.ac.kr; shkang@postech.ac.kr,"Lee, Sung-Yun/JDM-2887-2023","Lee, Sung-Yun/0000-0002-4141-6411; Park, Sunghye/0000-0002-1932-0763","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) [2019R1A5A1027055, 2020M3H2A107804514]; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) [RS-2023-00222085]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.(Samsung); Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A5A1027055, 2020M3H2A107804514), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and the Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant (No. RS-2023-00222085).",,32,0,0,5,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1933-7760,,979-8-3503-2225-5,ICCAD-IEEE ACM INT,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ICCAD57390.2023.10323942,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BW2HI,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001116715100178,0

We extend this geometry to a hypersphere and prove that maximizing modularity is equivalent to minimizing the angular distance to some modularity vector over the set of clustering vectors. In that sense, modularity-based community detection methods can be seen as a subclass of a more general class of projection methods, which we define as the community detection methods that adhere to the following two-step procedure: first, mapping the network to a point on the hypersphere; second, projecting this point to the set of clustering vectors. We show that this class of projection methods contains many interesting community detection methods. Many of these new methods cannot be described in terms of null models and resolution parameters, as is customary for modularity-based methods. We provide a new characterization of such methods in terms of meridians and latitudes of the hypersphere.

It presents a challenging NP-class problem, and as a result, numerous algorithms have been developed, each tailored to specific objectives and quality metrics for evaluation. This research commences by categorizing existing graph clustering algorithms based on two distinct perspectives: parameter-free algorithms and user-defined or adjustable parametric algorithms. Quality metrics are further categorized into three distinct groups: internal connectivity, external connectivity, and a combination of both. If a task can be represented by a simple undirected and unweighted graph, from a management and deployment of resources perspective, having clusters of some kind of similar density is advantageous as it allows efficient management. This research introduces a partitioning graph clustering algorithm that allows users to specify the desired density of a cluster by means of 'relative density'. Clustering process involves the determination of all triangles (i.e., smallest cliques) and selecting a clique as an initial cluster. The expansion of a cluster is done by adding adjacent cliques while the required relative density is monitored. Existing metrics are found unsuitable for evaluating the proposed method; therefore, a suitable new metric, the Mean Relative Density Deviation Coefficient (MRDDC), is introduced.","[Tariq, Rohi; Lavangnananda, Kittichai; Mongkolnam, Pornchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Bouvry, Pascal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp Sci, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of Luxembourg,"Lavangnananda, K (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",kittichai.lav@gmail.com,,"Lavangnananda, Kittichai/0000-0002-9227-4839; Mongkolnam, Pornchai/0000-0001-6069-1315","King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) through the Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship [49/2562]; Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) through the Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship; Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","This work was supported in part by the King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) through the Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship under Grant 49/2562; and in part by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg.",,75,1,1,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11.0,,,,,,122273.0,122294,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3329429,0.0,,,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,Y0EM9,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001102088000001,0

While certain technologies collect multiple measurements from the same cells simultaneously, even when modalities are separately assayed in different cells, we can apply novel computational methods to integrate these data. The application of computational integration methods to multimodal paired and unpaired data results in rich information about the identities of the cells present and the interactions between different levels of biology, such as between genetic variation and transcription.

There are many existing methods enabling us to evaluate the criticality ranking of links in networks, which are based on straightforward algorithms and topological features of analyzed graphs. In this paper, we offer another perspective on the problem and propose a novel approach, to be called the Evolutionary Approach (EA), that is based on a genetic-like algorithm and turns directly to an integral criterion of decomposition efficiency instead of network topology. Like all the genetic algorithms, EA is grounded on the iterative enhancement of randomly generated solutions via reproduction, cross-over, and mutation processes. The EA-efficiency is illustrated via decomposing three real-world benchmark networks by using the proposed method, the acknowledged Link Entropy (LE) method, and the most recent Improved Link Entropy (ILE) method. The comparison of the obtained results demonstrates that the EA-efficiency exceeds the ILE-efficiency for 5.7%-28.1% depending on the network complexity, with respect to the LE-efficiency the increase is approximately two-fold. Besides, the temporal aspects of ordering the network edges according to their significance using solely EA or in its combination with LE and ILE are discussed.","[Lubashevskiy, Vasily] Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, Kawagoe 3501197, Japan; [Lubashevsky, Ihor] HSE Tikhonov Moscow Inst Elect & Math, Moscow 123458, Russia",Tokyo International University,"Lubashevskiy, V (corresponding author), Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, Kawagoe 3501197, Japan.",vubashe@tiu.ac.jp,"Lubashevskiy, Vasily/JTU-7139-2023; Lubashevsky, Ihor/ABB-5637-2021","Lubashevskiy, Vasily/0000-0002-2399-5050;",,,,,62,0,0,3,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11.0,,,,,,58046.0,58054.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3284906,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,K0QQ1,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001013584000001,0

In this paper, we extend the study of these systems by applying different community detection algorithms on closely-related yeast transcriptional regulation networks to characterize their topological structure and understand if these methods are able to capture meaningful functional clusters of genes. We start by evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of a large group of algorithms by applying them to benchmark networks with ground-truth communities. We then apply the methods that had the best performance to the yeast networks to analyze the quality of the resulting structures, and then, assess the quality of the retrieved modules from a biological point of view using available annotated species' biological functions. Finally, we apply a multilayer community detection algorithm on multilayer networks, where each layer is an individual yeast network, and use available mappings between nodes of different species to successfully discover communities with genes that belong to different species but have similar biological functions. We conclude that the use of community detection algorithms to functionally characterize the modules of these networks might not be enough, suggesting the need of additional genetic information and possibly the use of alternative strategies to study these complex regulatory networks.","[Cruz, Fabio; Monteiro, Pedro T.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cruz, Fabio; Monteiro, Pedro T.] INESC ID, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cruz, Fabio; Teixeira, Andreia Sofia] Univ Lisbon, LASIGE, Dept Informat, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Cruz, F (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal.;Cruz, F (corresponding author), INESC ID, Lisbon, Portugal.;Cruz, F (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, LASIGE, Dept Informat, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal.",fabio.rocha.cruz@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Monteiro, Pedro T./E-5113-2010; Cruz, F√°bio/B-5902-2016; Teixeira, Andreia Sofia Monteiro/N-1702-2018","Monteiro, Pedro T./0000-0002-7934-5495; Cruz, F√°bio/0000-0003-0761-6628; Teixeira, Andreia Sofia Monteiro/0000-0002-2758-1891","national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [DSAIPA/AI/0033/2019, UIDB/50021/2020, UIDB/00408/2020, UIDP/00408/2020]",national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was supported by national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) with references DSAIPA/AI/0033/2019 (Project LAIfeBlood), UIDB/50021/2020, UIDB/00408/2020 and UIDP/00408/2020 (INESCID and LASIGE multi-annual funding, respectively).",,24,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-031-28278-2; 978-3-031-28276-8; 978-3-031-28275-1,SPRINGER PR COMPLEX,,,2023,,,,,,,38.0,49.0,,10.1007/978-3-031-28276-8_4,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV1YX,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001002078000004,0

In this paper, we investigate the impact of such initialization applied to the two most commonly used community detection algorithms: Louvain and Leiden. We use a partition obtained by embedding the nodes of the graph into some high dimensional space of real numbers and then running a clustering algorithm on this latent representation. We show that this procedure significantly improves the results. Proper embedding filters unnecessary information while retaining the proximity of nodes belonging to the same community. As a result, clustering algorithms ran on these embeddings merge nodes only when they are similar with a high degree of certainty, resulting in a stable and effective initial partition.","[Pankratz, Bartosz; Pralat, Pawel] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pankratz, Bartosz; Kaminski, Bogumil] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland",Toronto Metropolitan University; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pankratz, B (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Pankratz, B (corresponding author), SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland.",bartosz.pankratz@ryerson.ca; bkamins@sgh.waw.pl; pralat@ryerson.ca,"Pankratz, Bartosz/JFA-6346-2023","Pankratz, Bartosz/0000-0001-7618-9119",,,,,34,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-031-21133-1; 978-3-031-21131-7; 978-3-031-21130-0,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2023,1078.0,,,,,,221.0,232.0,,10.1007/978-3-031-21131-7_17,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BU9UI,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000963499200017,0

The detection process is usually complex and needs a lot of stages, which consumes time and effort. The limitation of the literature lies in providing methods that can be efficiently and easily adopted with minimum cost. This work proposes a novel approach for detecting counterfeit/forged documents. The proposed approach is based on network science approaches for analyzing documents' ink spectrums aiming to detect whether a document was counterfeited or forged. To this end, Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is used to retrieve the spectrums of the original and questioned documents. The extracted spectrums are formalized to create a dataset, which contains nodes (spectrums) and edges (correlations among spectrums). Then, the dataset is used to generate a network of spectrums that represented both the original and questioned documents. After that, the generated network is visualized and clustered. The detection process is mainly based on the information provided by network clusters (e.g., number of clusters). The results showed that the proposed approach was efficient in distinguishing documents. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to distinguish a document itself whether it was counterfeited by extracting the clusters of the questioned document.","[Amjed, Alaa; Mahmood, Basim] Univ Mosul, Dept Comp Sci, Mosul, Iraq; [AlMukhtar, Khalid A.

Community detection aims to extract these community structures from networks. Many community detection methods have been proposed that consider the problem from different perspectives. However, with the emergence of very large and complex networks from variety of domains, there has been a growing need for community detection methods that can operate at scale effectively and efficiently. Considering this, we propose a novel algorithm for large-scale community detection, based on two novel similarity indices we propose as well. In the first stage of our proposed algorithm, we generate candidate communities using a mechanism similar to information propagation very rapidly. Then, we merge small candidates that have fewer nodes than a calculated threshold with the larger ones using similarity between nodes and communities. Next, we engage a refinement operation on the candidates by moving all nodes to the candidates to which they are most similar using the same similarity index again. After that, we merge small communities with larger ones by using the similarity between communities until no gain in the modularity is obtained. Finally, in the last stage, we employ the same refinement operation as in the third stage. With an extensive experimentation on real-world and artificially-generated benchmark networks, we demonstrate and verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm scales very well with growing size and complexity of networks. Besides, our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art community detection methods both in detection performance and computation time.","[Tunali, Volkan] Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey",Maltepe University,"Tunali, V (corresponding author), Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey.",volkan.tunali@gmail.com,"TUNALI, Volkan/T-6717-2018","TUNALI, Volkan/0000-0002-2735-7996",,,,,38,5,5,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9.0,,,,,,78538,78552,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083971,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TJ9NL,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000673798800001,0

Because these protein-protein interaction networks, or interactomes, represent pairwise connections within a hierarchically organized system, it is often useful to identify higher-order associations embedded within them, such as multi-member protein complexes. Graph-based clustering techniques are widely used to accomplish this goal, and dozens of field-specific and general clustering algorithms exist. However, interactomes can be prone to errors, especially when inferred from high-throughput biochemical assays. Therefore, robustness to network-level noise is an important criterion. Here, we tested the robustness of a range of graph-based clustering algorithms in the presence of noise, including algorithms common across domains and those specific to protein networks. Strikingly, we found that all of the clustering algorithms tested here markedly amplified network-level noise. Randomly rewiring only 1% of network edges yielded more than a 50% change in clustering results. Moreover, we found the impact of network noise on individual clusters was not uniform: some clusters were consistently robust to injected noise, whereas others were not. Therefore we developed the clust.perturb R package and Shiny web application to measure the reproducibility of clusters by randomly perturbing the network. We show that clust.-perturb results are predictive of real-world cluster stability: poorly reproducible clusters as identified by clust.perturb are significantly less likely to be reclustered across experiments. We conclude that graph-based clustering amplifies noise in protein interaction networks, but quantifying the robustness of a cluster to network noise can separate stable protein complexes from spurious associations.","[Stacey, R.

However, many real-world networks are characterized by uncertainty, leading to the notion of uncertain or probabilistic graphs. The transition from deterministic graphs to uncertain graphs introduces new challenges. We present USIWO, an efficient and practical solution for community search in unweighted uncertain graphs with edge uncertainty. In addition to being accurate, the approach utilizes an efficient data structure for storing only the relevant parts of the network in main memory, eliminating the need to store the entire graph, making it a valuable tool in finding the core of a community on very large uncertain graphs, when there is limited time and memory available. The algorithm operates through a one-node-expansion approach, based on the concepts of strong and weak links within a graph.

Such clustering suffers from issues related to the so-called resolution limit or requires resolution tuning. This has been changed by recent theories and algorithms for graph clustering with resolution variation. The requirement for specifying or tuning the gamma-hyperparameter is effectively removed, and the clustering function becomes or transforms to a functional form with gamma as an internal resolution variable. We address a standing and significant challenge in parallel clustering with resolution variation. We identify and remove the key bottlenecks in search operations confined to a specific gamma value, and reduce and minimize redundant search operations at different gamma values.

Stochastic block partitioning (SBP) is a community detection algorithm based on sequential Bayesian inference. SBP is highly accurate even on graphs with a complex community structure. However, it does not scale well to large real-world graphs that can contain upwards of a million vertices due to its sequential nature. Approximate methods that break computational dependencies improve the scalability of SBP via parallelization and data reduction. However, these relaxations can lead to low accuracy on graphs with complex community structure. In this paper, we introduce additional synchronization steps through vertex-level data batching to improve the accuracy of such methods. We then leverage batching to develop a high-performance parallel approach that improves the scalability of SBP while maintaining accuracy. Our approach is the first to integrate data reduction, shared-memory parallelization, and distributed computation, thus efficiently utilizing distributed computing resources to accelerate SBP. On a one-million vertex graph processed on 64 compute nodes with 128 cores each, our approach delivers a speedup of 322x over the sequential baseline and 6.8x over the distributed-only implementation.

Moreover, there are several options for the graph representation of an MLN: for example, directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and using information from all or only some layers. Although these options may affect the results of community detection in MLNs, representations that are effective for community detection have not yet been clarified. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of three types of community detection algorithms for MLNs and examine how the graph representation of an MLN affects the results of these algorithms. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The flattening approach is particularly effective, whereas the layer-by-layer approach is not applicable to detecting communities in MLNs of Twitter users. (2) Using a directed graph for each layer of an MLN increases the accuracy of community detection. (3) The Leiden method, which is a community detection algorithm for single-layer networks, achieves comparable accuracy with the community detection algorithms for MLNs, which suggests that there exists room for improvement in multilayer community detection algorithms for effectively utilizing the multilayer structures of MLNs.","[Suzuki, Daiki] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Engn Informat & Syst, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Tsugawa, Sho] Univ Tsukuba, Inst Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Suzuki, D (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Engn Informat & Syst, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",,,,JSPS KAKENHI [22K11990],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 22K11990.,,28,0,0,1,1,COMPLEX SYSTEMS PUBLICATIONS INC,CHAMPAIGN,"PO BOX 6149, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61826 USA",0891-2513,,,COMPLEX SYST,Complex Syst.,,2023,32.0,2.0,,,SI,,211.0,228,,10.25088/ComplexSystems.32.2.211,0.0,,,18,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Mathematics,JY6D2,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001176749900006,0

Therefore, this research aims to improve the performance of cluster-GCN by changing the community detection algorithm, specifically by using Leiden algorithm as an alternative. Originally, Leiden algorithm is claimed to be powerful in identifying communities in networks. Nevertheless, the common feature of community detection algorithms makes nodes in the same community tend to be similar. For that reason, this research also proposes to add constraints such as minimum/maximum community size and overlapping communities to increase community diversity. By combining the above approaches with a careful analysis of protein data, our experiments on a single 8 GB GPU show that the performance of Cluster-GCN on the ogbn-proteins dataset could be improved by a 0.98% ROC-AUC score.","[Nguyen Bao Phuoc; Duong Thuy Trang; Phan Duy Hung] FPT Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam",FPT University,"Hung, PD (corresponding author), FPT Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",phuocnbhe153036@fpt.edu.vn; trangdthe150573@fpt.edu.vn; hungpd2@fe.edu.vn,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-981-99-5836-8; 978-981-99-5837-5,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2023,13996.0,,,,,,157.0,169,,10.1007/978-981-99-5837-5_14,0.0,,,13,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW4SW,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001155004600014,0

Sometimes, the hypotheses are embedded in a space; the distances between the hypotheses reflect their co-null/co-alternative patterns. Properly incorporating the distance information in testing will boost testing power. Hence, we developed a new multiple testing framework named Distance Assisted Recursive Testing (DART). DART features in joint artificial intelligence (AI) and statistics modeling. It has two stages. The first stage uses AI models to construct an aggregation tree that reflects the distance information. The second stage uses statistical models to embed the testing on the tree and control the false discovery rate. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrated that DART generates valid, robust, and powerful results. We applied DART to a clinical trial in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation study to identify the gut microbiota whose abundance was impacted by post-transplant care.","[Li, Xuechan; Xie, Jichun] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Sung, Anthony D.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Li, XC (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biostat, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",XUECHAN.LI@DUKE.EDU; ANTHONY.SUNG@DUKE.EDU; JICHUN.XIE@DUKE.EDU,,,"Duke University; NIH [1-R01-HL151365, 1-R01-HG012555- 01]",Duke University; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),The microbiome samples were collected and sequenced at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and pre -processed at Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BSR) .

One possible solution to handle such cases is to employ hierarchical RL (HRL). In this work, we present two methods to autonomously construct (1) skills (ASKA) and (2) arbitrarily elaborate superskills or complexes through defining an arbitrary number of hierarchies in HRL (ASKAC) over a graph-based iteratively-growing environment model. We employ dynamic community detection (DCD) in detecting subgoals since DCD considers local changes only over the partially growing graphs and lowers the time complexity of the subgoal detection where groups of environment states (i.e., subenvironments) are modeled by communities from the graph theory. DCD's drawback is oversegmentation where it mispartitions a subenvironment further into smaller components. To maintain the robustness of ASKAC against DCD's possible oversegmentation we introduce the concept of skill coupling. Skill coupling does not only robustly solve the oversegmentation issue, but it also improves HRL by building up more elaborate complexes (i.e., skill compositions) obtained at an arbitrary number of hierarchies and reduces the number of decisions leading to the goal employing these complexes. In addition to the experiments that investigate the effect of parameters, proposed methods are experimentally evaluated in grid world and taxi driver benchmark environments.","[Kumralbas, Zeynep; Cavus, Semiha Hazel; Coskun, Kutalmis; Tumer, Borahan] Marmara Univ, Fac Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye",Marmara University,"Kumralbas, Z (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Fac Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye.",zeynep.kumralbas@mind-rg.com; hazel.cavus@mind-rg.com; kutalmis.coskun@mind-rg.com; borahan.tumer@marmara.edu.tr,"Tumer, Borahan/HZL-9525-2023","Kumralbas, Zeynep/0000-0002-2759-4924; Cavus, Semiha Hazel/0000-0002-9680-1325; Coskun, Kutalmis/0000-0001-7680-3182; Tumer, Borahan/0000-0001-6880-5153",,,,,37,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1868-6478,1868-6486,,EVOL SYST-GER,Evol.

Although these networks can be analyzed by different means, visual analytics stands out as an effective way for a pre-analysis before doing quantitative/statistical analyses to identify patterns, anomalies, and other behaviors in the data, thus leading to new insights and better decision-making. However, the large number of nodes, edges, and/or timestamps in many real-world networks may lead to polluted layouts that make the analysis inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, we propose LargeNetVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to assist in analyzing small and large temporal networks. It successfully achieves this goal by leveraging three taxonomies focused on network communities to guide the visual exploration process. The system is composed of four interactive visual components: the first (Taxonomy Matrix) presents a summary of the network characteristics, the second (Global View) gives an overview of the network evolution, the third (a node-link diagram) enables community- and node-level structural analysis, and the fourth (a Temporal Activity Map - TAM) shows the community- and node-level activity under a temporal perspective. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of LargeNetVis through two usage scenarios and a user study with 14 participants.","[Linhares, Claudio D. G.; Pedro, Diogenes S.; Traina, Agma J.

Discovering the relationships between these addresses and clustering the addresses of individual users helps infer the identity of the addresses. By analyzing the association of addresses in UTXO, it is found that multiple input addresses of a transaction are controlled by the same user, and thus the bitcoin addresses can be clustered. The transactions between the user data obtained after clustering are communality, so the Louvain algorithm is further used to analyze the relationship between users, the visual results are used to present the association between users, and the impact of the number of users on the algorithm results is analyzed. Finally, the Leiden algorithm proposed to solve the problem that Louvain algorithm may have poor connectivity or even disconnection between communities is used to discover the community of the clustered user data.

Clustering algorithms play an important role in finding these groups accurately and at scale.

We designed a realistic benchmark for local IBD graphs and utilized it to compare the statistical power of clustering algorithms via simulating 2.3 million clusters across 850 experiments. We found Infomap and Markov Clustering (MCL) community detection methods to have high statistical power in most of the scenarios. They yield a 30% increase in power compared to the current state-of-art approach, with a 3 orders of magnitude lower runtime. We also found that standard clustering metrics, such as modularity, cannot predict statistical power of algorithms in IBD mapping applications. We extend our findings to real datasets by analyzing the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study dataset with 51,000 samples and 2 million shared segments on Chromosome 1, resulting in the extraction of 39 million local IBD clusters. We demonstrate the power of our approach by recovering signals of rare genetic variation in the Whole-Exome Sequence data of 200,000 individuals in the UK Biobank.

In contrast to existing approaches, ECS is able to function without labels for user ideologies and makes no assumptions about the structure of the interaction graph. To facilitate measuring distances between users, we propose EchoGAE, a self-supervised graph autoencoder-based user embedding model that leverages users' posts and the interaction graph to embed them in a manner that reflects their ideological similarity.

With the increasing awareness of data security and privacy protection, the need to understand the impact of such attacks on traditional community detection algorithms emerges. To this end, we investigate the community obfuscation problem which aims to hide a target set of communities from being detected by perturbing the network structure. We identify and analyze the Matthew effect incurred by the classical quality function based methods, which essentially results in the imbalanced allocation of perturbation resources. To mitigate such effect, we propose a probabilistic framework named as ProHiCo to hide communities. The key idea of ProHiCo is to first allocate the resource of perturbations randomly and fairly and then choose the appropriate edges to perturb via likelihood minimization. Our ProHiCo framework provides the additional freedom to choose the generative graph model with community structure. By incorporating the stochastic block model and its degree-corrected variant into the ProHiCo framework, we develop two scalable and effective algorithms called SBM and DCSBM. Via extensive experiments on 8 real-world networks and 5 community detection algorithms, we show that both SBM and DCSBM are about 30x faster than the prominent baselines in the literature when there are around 500 target communities, while their performance is comparable to the baselines.","[Liu, Xuecheng; Fu, Luoyi; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hopcroft, John E.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Cornell University,"Liu, XC (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",liuxuecheng@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; jeh@cs.cornell.edu,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100302]; NSF China [62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012]",National Key R&D Program of China; NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China 2018YFB2100302, and NSF China under Grant (No. 62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012).",,32,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-166X,,978-0-7381-1281-7,IEEE INFOCOM SER,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488870,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BS2JU,,,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000702210400204,0

We analyze 412 Java systems and evaluate the cohesion of the extracted communities using four document representation techniques. The evaluation aims to find which algorithm extracts the most semantically cohesive, yet separated communities. The results show a good performance in both algorithms, however, each has its own strengths. Leiden extracts less cohesive, but better separated, and better clustered components that depend more on similar ones. Infomap, on the other side, creates more cohesive, slightly overlapping clusters that are less likely to depend on other semantically similar components.","[Sas, Cezar; Capiluppi, Andrea] Univ Groningen, Bernoulli Inst, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Sas, C (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Bernoulli Inst, Groningen, Netherlands.",c.a.sas@rug.nl; a.capiluppi@rug.nl,"Sas, Cezar/JMQ-9798-2023; Capiluppi, Andrea/AGO-2961-2022","Sas, Cezar/0000-0002-3018-0140; Capiluppi, Andrea/0000-0001-9469-6050",,,,,27,1,1,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-9630-5,,,,2021,,,,,,,546.0,550.0,,10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00063,0.0,,,5,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR9HX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000675825200054,0

Contra the literature, we find that (3) there is no move away from heterodox economics in the main journals: no significant interest was present to begin with.

Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.","[Honnorat, Nicolas; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Saranathan, Manojkumar] Univ Arizona, Dept Med Imaging, Coll Med, 1501 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Sullivan, Edith, V; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",SRI International; University of Arizona; Stanford University,"Zahr, NM (corresponding author), SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;Zahr, NM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicolas.honnorat@sri.com; manojsar@radiology.arizona.edu; edie@stanford.edu; dolfp@stanford.edu; kilian.pohl@stanford.edu; nzahr@stanford.edu,"Zahr, Natalie/W-5292-2019; Saranathan, Manojkumar/O-4353-2019; Sullivan, Edith V/ABD-5684-2021; Zahr, Natalie/L-7692-2016","Sullivan, Edith V/0000-0001-6739-3716; Zahr, Natalie/0000-0002-3346-4894; Saranathan, Manoj/0000-0001-9020-9948; Pohl, Kilian/0000-0001-5416-5159","National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH113406]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH113406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [U01AA017347] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),"This study was supported with grant funding from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723, and National Institute of Mental Health: R01 MH113406.",,114,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0376-8716,1879-0046,,DRUG ALCOHOL DEPEN,Drug Alcohol Depend.,MAR 1,2021,220.0,,,,,,,,108509,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108509,0.0,,JAN 2021,10,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,QK3QW,33453503.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000620296200008,0

We decoded the identity of 21 transcriptomic clusters corresponding to 20 PN types and developed methods to match transcriptomic clusters representing the same PN type across development. We discovered that PN transcriptomes reflect unique biological processes unfolding at each stage-neurite growth and pruning during metamorphosis at an early pupal stage; peaked transcriptomic diversity during olfactory circuit assembly at mid-pupal stages; and neuronal signaling in adults. At early developmental stages, PN types with adjacent birth order share similar transcriptomes.

We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment.

But whether this holds true is still an open question. Here we investigate the productivity trajectories of almost 8500 scientists from over 50 disciplines using methods from time-series analysis, dimensionality reduction, and network science, showing that there exist six universal productivity patterns in research. Based on clusters of productivity trajectories and network representations where researchers with similar productivity patterns are connected, we identify constant, u-shaped, decreasing, periodic-like, increasing, and canonical productivity patterns, with the latter two describing almost three-fourths of researchers. In fact, we find that canonical curves are the most prevalent, but contrary to expectations, productivity peaks occur much more frequently around midcareer rather than early. These results outline the boundaries of possible career paths in science and caution against the adoption of stereotypes in tenure and funding decisions.","[Sunahara, Andre S.; Ribeiro, Haroldo V.] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Fis, BR-87020900 Maringa, PR, Brazil; [Perc, Matjaz] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Perc, Matjaz] China Med Univ Hosp, China Med Univ, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan; [Perc, Matjaz] Alma Mater Europaea, Slovenska Ulica 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Perc, Matjaz] Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Josefstadterstr 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Perc, Matjaz] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Phys, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Universidade Estadual de Maringa; University of Maribor; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; Kyung Hee University,"Ribeiro, HV (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Fis, BR-87020900 Maringa, PR, Brazil.",hvr@dfi.uem.br,"Ribeiro, Haroldo Valentin/C-8614-2012; Perc, Matjaz/A-5148-2009","Ribeiro, Haroldo Valentin/0000-0002-9532-5195; Perc, Matjaz/0000-0002-3087-541X; Sunahara, Andre Seiji/0000-0002-4666-9995","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [303533/2021-8]; Slovenian Research Agency [J1-2457, P1-0403]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors acknowledge the support of the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) , the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Grant No. 303533/2021-8) , and the Slovenian Research Agency (Grants No. J1-2457 and No. P1-0403) .",,65,4,4,4,6,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",,2643-1564,,PHYS REV RES,Phys.

However, batch information caused by batch effects is often confused with the intrinsic biological information in scRNA-seq data, which makes accurate clustering quite challenging. A Deep Adaptive Clustering with Adversarial Learning method (DACAL) is proposed here. DACAL jointly optimizes the batch correcting and clustering processes to remove batch effects while retaining biological information. DACAL achieves batch correction and adaptive clustering without requiring manually specified cell types or resolution parameters. DACAL is compared with other widely used batch correction and clustering methods on human pancreas datasets from different sequencing platforms and mouse mammary datasets from different laboratories. The results demonstrate that DACAL can correct batch effects efficiently and adaptively find accurate cell types, outperforming competing methods. Moreover, it can obtain cell subtypes with biological meanings.","[An, Sijing; Shi, Jinhui; Liu, Runyan; Wang, Jing; Hu, Shuofeng; Dong, Guohua; Ying, Xiaomin; He, Zhen] Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China",Academy of Military Medical Sciences - China,"Ying, XM; He, Z (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China.",ansijing66@gmail.com; shijinhui93@163.com; runyanliu11@gmail.com; jingwangv@foxmail.com; hushuofeng08@163.com; dgh1991.learn@gmail.com; yingxm@bmi.ac.cn; hezhen1@bmi.ac.cn,"Shi, Jinhui/KHZ-9803-2024; Wang, Jing/JYO-7698-2024; An, Sijing/KEE-6797-2024","Shi, Jinhui/0009-0001-0292-1298; Ying, Xiaomin/0000-0001-6126-7372",National Key R&D Program of China,National Key R&D Program of China,No Statement Available,,25,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,DEC,2023,11.0,24,,,,,,,4901,10.3390/math11244901,0.0,,,12,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,DF8D9,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001130697300001,0

Despite the abundance of proposed methods for extracting primary topics, only a few works investigated the influence of text length on the performance of keyword extraction (KE) methods. Specifically, many studies lean on abstracts and titles for content extraction from papers, leaving it uncertain whether leveraging the complete content of papers can yield consistent results. Hence, in this study, we employ a network-based approach to evaluate the concordance between keywords extracted from abstracts and those from the entire papers. Community detection methods are utilized to identify interconnected papers in citation networks. Subsequently, paper clusters are formed to identify salient terms within each cluster, employing a methodology akin to the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) approach. Once each cluster has been endowed with its distinctive set of key terms, these selected terms are employed to serve as representative keywords at the paper level. The top-ranked words at the cluster level, which also appear in the abstract, are chosen as keywords for the paper. Our findings indicate that although various community detection methods used in KE yield similar levels of accuracy. Notably, text clustering approaches outperform all citation-based methods, while all approaches yield relatively low accuracy values. We also identified a lack of concordance between keywords extracted from the abstracts and those extracted from the corresponding full-text source. Considering that citations and text clustering yield distinct outcomes, combining them in hybrid approaches could offer improved performance.","[Tohalino, Jorge A.

Differential cell abundance supports the initial clustering of all cells; then, the number of cells per cluster and sample are evaluated, and the dependence of these counts concerning the phenotypic covariates of the samples is studied. Analysis heavily depends on the clustering method. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM or k-medoids) represents a well-established clustering procedure that leverages the downstream interpretation of clusters by pinpointing real individuals in the dataset as cluster centers (medoids) without reducing dimensions. Of note, PAM suffers from high computational costs and memory requirements.ResultsThis paper proposes a method for differential abundance analysis using PAM as a clustering method and negative binomial regression as a statistical model to relate covariates to cluster/cell counts. We used this approach to study the differential cell abundance of human endometrial cell types throughout the natural secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. We developed a new R package -scellpam-, that incorporates an efficient parallel C++ implementation of PAM, and applied this package in this study. We compared the PAM-BS clustering method with other methods and evaluated both the computational aspects of its implementation and the quality of the classifications obtained using distinct published datasets with known subpopulations that demonstrate promising results.ConclusionsThe implementation of PAM-BS, included in the scellpam package, exhibits robust performance in terms of speed and memory usage compared to other related methods. PAM allowed quick and robust clustering of sets of cells with a size ranging from 70,000 to 300,000 cells. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scellpam/index.html. Finally, our approach provides important new insights into the transient subpopulations associated with the fertile time frame when applied to the study of changes in the human endometrium during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.","[Domingo, Juan] Univ Valencia, Dept Informat, ETSE, Avda Univ S-N, Valencia 46100, Spain; [Kutsyr-Kolesnyk, Oleksandra; Leon, Teresa; Ayala, Guillermo] Univ Valencia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Avda Vicente Andres Estelles, Valencia 46100, Spain; [Perez-Moraga, Raul; Roson, Beatriz] INCL Hlth Res Inst, Carlos Simon Fdn, Valencia 46012, Spain; [Perez-Moraga, Raul] Igenomix R&D, Technol Pk, Valencia 46980, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Domingo, J (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Informat, ETSE, Avda Univ S-N, Valencia 46100, Spain.;Roson, B (corresponding author), INCL Hlth Res Inst, Carlos Simon Fdn, Valencia 46012, Spain.",Juan.Domingo@uv.es; broson@fundacioncarlossimon.com,"Ayala, Guillermo/A-8077-2008; Domingo, Juan/E-9709-2018; Roson Burgo, Beatriz/ABA-6235-2021","Domingo, Juan/0000-0003-4728-6256; Roson Burgo, Beatriz/0000-0002-9851-2025","Spanish Ministry of Science and Education, MCIN, AEI/10.13039/501100011033/","Spanish Ministry of Science and Education, MCIN, AEI/10.13039/501100011033/(German Research Foundation (DFG))",None applicable.,,57,1,1,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,NOV 22,2023,24.0,1,,,,,,,440,10.1186/s12859-023-05569-6,0.0,,,26,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Y8LM3,37990148.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001107719800002,0

This heterogeneity can represent different ways in which psychological processes manifest, either between people or within a person across time. In many instances, those differences can have systematic patterns that can be related to future outcomes. In close relationships, for example, the daily exchange of affect between two individuals in a couple can contain a particular structure that is different across people and can result in varying levels of relationship satisfaction. In this paper we use Louvain, a clustering method, as a tool to characterize heterogeneity in multivariate time series data. Using affect measures from dyadic interactions, we first determine that Louvain is adept at detecting homogeneous patterns that are distinct from one another. Additionally, these homogeneous points are linked, at some level, by time. Thus, we find that clustering via Louvain is useful to find time periods of stable, reoccurring patterns. However, using measures founded on information theory reveals that there is some level of information loss that is inevitable when clustering on levels of variable expression. Finally, we evaluate the predictive validity of the clustering method by examining the relation between the identified clusters of affect and measures outside the time series (i.e., relationship satisfaction and breakup taken one and two years later).","[Aragones, Samuel D.; Ferrer, Emilio] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA USA; [Aragones, Samuel D.] Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Aragones, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sdaragones@ucdavis.edu,,"Aragones, Samuel/0000-0002-5071-797X; Ferrer, Emilio/0000-0001-7520-046X",,,,,56,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0027-3171,1532-7906,,MULTIVAR BEHAV RES,Multivariate Behav.

In this study, we explore the driving role of social networks in the consensus-reaching process from the perspective of structural holes and construct a social network-driven bi-level minimum cost consensus model (MCCM) for LSGDM. The bi-level MCCM reflects the Stackelberg game between the moderator and decision-makers, in which two structural hole indices are used to obtain the weight of decision-makers and facilitate consensus-reaching, respectively. We analyze the Nash equilibrium strategy and design a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the bi-level MCCM. Furthermore, we implement the proposed bi-level MCCM on a social network generated from a real dataset. Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the implementation results shows the decisive role of social networks driving large-scale group consensus-reaching and reveals the relationship between position and benefit in the social network of decision-makers. Accordingly, management implications are given for LSGDM for both research and practice.","[Qin, Jindong; Wang, Di] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Qin, Jindong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Res Ctr Data Sci & Intelligent Decis Making, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Qin, Jindong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Res Inst Digital Governance & Management Decis Inn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liang, Yingying] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; Hebei University of Technology,"Qin, JD (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",qinjindongseu@126.com,,"Qin, Jindong/0000-0002-6182-3815",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72071151]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2023CFB712],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province),"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Project 72071151, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2023CFB712) .",,48,6,6,37,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0020-0255,1872-6291,,INFORM SCIENCES,Inf.

To preserve such communi-ties, it is important to understand their robustness under network perturbations. Previous work in community robustness analysis has focused on studying changes in the community structure as a response of edge rewiring and node or edge removal. However, the impact of increasing connectivity on the robustness of communities in networked systems is relatively unexplored. Studying the limits of community robustness under edge addition is crucial to better understanding the cases in which density expands or false edges erroneously appear. In this paper, we analyze the effect of edge addition on community robustness in synthetic and empirical temporal networks. We study two scenarios of edge addition: random and targeted. We use four community detection algorithms, Infomap, Label Propagation, Leiden , Louvain, and demonstrate the results in community similarity metrics. The experiments on synthetic networks show that communities are more robust when the initial partition is stronger or the edge addition is random, and the experiments on empirical data also indicate that robustness performance can be affected by the community similarity metric. Overall, our results suggest that the communities identified by the different types of community detection algorithms exhibit different levels of robustness, and so the robustness of communities depends strongly on the choice of detection method.","[Tian, Moyi] Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Moriano, Pablo] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Comp Sci & Math Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",Brown University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Tian, MY (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",moyi_tian@brown.edu; moriano@ornl.gov,"Moriano, Pablo/AAC-6334-2021","Moriano, Pablo/0000-0002-1822-8885; Tian, Moyi/0000-0001-8166-7410",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,"This paper has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

Identifying the most influential spreaders in networks is vital to controlling and understanding the spreading process of infectious diseases. We used Baidu Migration data for the whole year of 2021 to build mobility networks. The nodes of the network represent cities, and the edges represent the population flow be-tween cities. By applying the k-shell decomposition and the Louvain algorithm, we could get the k-shell values for each city and community partition. Then, we identified the most efficient nodes or pathways in a complex network by generating random networks. Furthermore, we analyzed the eigenvalue of the migration matrix to find the nodes that have the most impact on the network. We also found the consistency between k-shell value and eigenvalue through Kendall's T test. The main result is that in Spring Festival and National Day, the network is at higher risk of an infectious disease outbreak and the Yangtze River Delta is at the highest risk of an epidemic all year around. Shanghai is the most significant node in both k-shell value and eigenvalue analysis. The spatiotemporal property of the network should be taken into account to model the transmission of infectious diseases more accurately.(c) 2023 The Authors.

In this paper, we have proposed a three-step parallel algorithm, Par-Com, using the concept of k Clique and modularity optimization to address both of the above issues. The proposed algorithm increases the execution speed and also improves the quality of the community formed by optimizing modularity. Par-Com uses dynamic load balancing on the multicore architecture of Supercomputer ParamShivay. We have also evaluated Par-Com's performance against nine sequential and three parallel community detection algorithms on varying size datasets, i.e. karate, macaque, email, immuno, soc-epinions, facebook, and com-Friendster. The experiment result shows that Par-Com outperforms other algorithms under consideration with up to 45% increase in modularity and up to 84% increase in execution speed. Par-Com is also capable of detecting overlapping communities, fuzzy membership of each node, most influential node in each community formed, and outlier nodes. Nodes within a community that have the highest influence are deemed as experts. The choices made by an expert in a particular community are served as recommendations to other users within that community.","[Singh, Dipika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, India; [Garg, Rakhi] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, MMV, Varanasi, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, India.",dipikaa.ssingh@gmail.com; dipika.singh4@bhu.ac.in,,,University Grants Commission,"University Grants Commission(University Grants Commission, India)",This work was supported by University Grants Commission.,,41,0,0,2,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0256-4602,0974-5971,,IETE TECH REV,IETE Tech.

In this study, we collected a novel and comprehensive dataset containing information on approximately 14,000 graduate students majoring in computer science (CS) at the top 25 North American universities. We used statistical hypothesis tests to determine whether there is a preference for students' gender and nationality in the admission processes.

However, the low accuracy can be attributed to the fact that traditional algorithms always pay more attention on networks' structural information of lower-order, i.e. neglect that of higher-order. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Graph Embedding based on Motif-aware Feature Propagation (GEMFP) for community detection. In graph embedding, the vector representation of each node in a graph is firstly initialized at random. Then, we reconstruct a weighted graph instead of the original one by considering the information of lower-order (adjacency interactions) as well as higher -order (motifs), which is further used to define the influence acceptance between nodes, and the representation of a node is determined by aggregating the information of its neighbors' influence iteratively until the convergence of this process is reached. Finally, K-means algorithm is adopted to extract communities by using the above embedding information. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 real-world datasets, and the results show that our algorithm tends to be more effective for community detection compared with several traditional, and graph embedding algorithms.

With a unique large-scale logistics data set, logistics networks between cities in China are constructed. We thus identify communities of cities that have dense logistics connections in these networks. The cities in the communities are found to exhibit strong connections in the economy, resources, and industry. The detected communities are also aligned with the urban agglomerations mentioned in the guidelines reported by the National Development and Reform Commission of China. We further extend our analysis to assess the resilience of the city logistics networks, especially focusing on the influence of community structures. Random and intentional attacks are considered in our resilience analysis. Our results reveal that the city logistics networks are robust to the random attacks and are vulnerable to the intentional attacks on the nodes with dense links between and within communities. Our results not only deepen our understanding of the community structure and resilience of the city logistics networks but also provide insights on how to improve the efficiency and safety of intercity logistics.","[Ma, Jun-Chao; Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Ma, Yin-Jie] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jun-Chao; Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Ma, Yin-Jie] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jun-Chao] Univ Fribourg, Dept Phys, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Dai, Yue-Hua] Shanghai Dev Strategy Res Inst, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology; University of Fribourg,"Jiang, ZQ (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZQ (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",jcma@mail.ecust.edu.cn; zqjiang@ecust.edu.cn; yjma@mail.ecust.edu.cn; yuehua.dai@fzzx.sh.gov.cn,"Jiang, Zhi-Qiang/B-5746-2008","Jiang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4013-1753; Ma, Jun-Chao/0000-0001-6136-5650",The authors are grateful to Shanghai Yunyou Logistics Company for providing the data sets and the anonymous referees for valuable suggestions.,The authors are grateful to Shanghai Yunyou Logistics Company for providing the data sets and the anonymous referees for valuable suggestions.,The authors are grateful to Shanghai Yunyou Logistics Company for providing the data sets and the anonymous referees for valuable suggestions.,,61,0,0,33,61,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,OCT,2023,11.0,20,,,,,,,4352,10.3390/math11204352,0.0,,,15,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,W7RI6,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:001093558100001,0

The innovative structural information theory (SInfo, introduced by Li et al.) has achieved excellent performance for network analysis. Nevertheless, similar to traditional network algorithms, the SInfo algorithm will exhaust all system memory resources when processing large-scale networks based on adjacency data structures. Moreover, due to the irregular and sequential characteristics, the SInfo algorithm is challenging to parallelize. In this article, we propose a hybrid sparse data structure and design a low-memory community detection algorithm based on structural information theory (HSSInfo), which shrinks memory requirements and achieves high parallelism. Specifically, we first propose a general quantization method to quantify the information change in community transformation, with which community inner and outer connection complexity can be semantically interpreted. Second, we design a general hybrid sparse structure to store network data among CPU and GPU, which can reduce memory resource consumption for community detection on large-scale networks. Finally, we develop an HSSInfo algorithm based on the quantization method and hybrid sparse structure, in which parallelism intersection and community fusion algorithms are employed to improve parallel scalability. We execute the comparison experiments for HSSInfo and eleven baseline algorithms on nine real-world datasets. Empirically, HSSInfo can achieve orders of magnitude speedups and extend structural information theory to large-scale datasets of billions of edges. Meanwhile, compared with various community detection algorithms, HSSInfo can achieve higher or similar accuracy with up to 19x memory shrinkage ratio.","[Zhu, Weiguo; Sun, Yongqi; Fang, Rongqiang; Xu, Baomin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Big Data & Artificial Intelligence Transpo, Minist Educ, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Weiguo; Sun, Yongqi; Fang, Rongqiang; Xu, Baomin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Xu, BM (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Big Data & Artificial Intelligence Transpo, Minist Educ, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.;Xu, BM (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zhuweiguo@bjtu.edu.cn; yqsun@bjtu.edu.cn; rqfang@bjtu.edu.cn; bmxu@bjtu.edu.cn,"Zhu, Weiguo/ISU-5411-2023","Zhu, Weiguo/0000-0002-7802-3339; Fang, Rongqiang/0000-0003-2353-0920","National Key Ramp;D Program of China [2021ZD0113002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072292, 61572005, 61771058]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2020YJS032]",National Key Ramp;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Key R & amp;D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0113002, in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62072292, 61572005, 61771058, and in part by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under Grant 2020YJS032.& nbsp;",,39,0,0,2,7,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1045-9219,1558-2183,,IEEE T PARALL DISTR,IEEE Trans.

In addition, compared with existing methods, we show that only the proposed GNDA method adequately estimates the number of latent variables (LVs). (2) The proposed GNDA already considers any symmetric and nonsymmetric similarity functions between indicators (i.e., variables or observations) to specify LVs. (3) The proposed prefiltering and resolution parameters provide the hierarchical version of GNDA to check the robustness of LVs.

In this article we present a novel approach to partition road networks through network modularity to produce data-driven static traffic assignment models from loop detector data on large road systems. The use of partitioning allows the estimation of the key model input of Origin-Destination demand matrices from flow counts alone. Previous network tomography-based demand estimation techniques have been limited by the network size. The amount of partitioning changes the Origin-Destination estimation optimisation problems to different levels of computational difficulty. Different approaches to utilising the partitioning were tested, one which degenerated the road network to the scale of the partitions and others which left the network intact. Applied to a subnetwork of England's Strategic Road Network and other test networks, our results for the degenerate case showed flow and travel time errors are reasonable with a small amount of degeneration. The results for the non-degenerate cases showed that similar errors in model prediction with lower computation requirements can be obtained when using large partitions compared with the non-partitioned case. This work could be used to improve the effectiveness of national road systems planning and infrastructure models.","[Roocroft, Alexander; Punzo, Giuliano] Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England; [Roocroft, Alexander; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore",University of Sheffield; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC),"Roocroft, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England.;Roocroft, A (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore.",aroocroft1@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Ramli, Muhamad Azfar/0000-0002-6321-0828; Roocroft, Alexander/0000-0002-6551-1800","The authors would like to express their thanks to the University of Sheffield and the Agency for Science, Technology amp; Research (A*STAR) under the A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP) for funding this project.

This study aims to identify drug repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM by developing an integrative rare disease profile network containing heterogeneous types of biomedical data.MethodsWe developed a Glioblastoma-based Biomedical Profile Network (GBPN) by extracting and integrating biomedical information pertinent to GBM-related diseases from the NCATS GARD Knowledge Graph (NGKG). We further clustered the GBPN based on modularity classes which resulted in multiple focused subgraphs, named mc_GBPN. We then identified high-influence nodes by performing network analysis over the mc_GBPN and validated those nodes that could be potential drug repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM.ResultsWe developed the GBPN with 1,466 nodes and 107,423 edges and consequently the mc_GBPN with forty-one modularity classes. A list of the ten most influential nodes were identified from the mc_GBPN. These notably include Riluzole, stem cell therapy, cannabidiol, and VK-0214, with proven evidence for treating GBM.ConclusionOur GBM-targeted network analysis allowed us to effectively identify potential candidates for drug repurposing or repositioning. Further validation will be conducted by using other different types of biomedical and clinical data and biological experiments. The findings could lead to less invasive treatments for glioblastoma while significantly reducing research costs by shortening the drug development timeline.

Such techniques provide a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in both health and disease that cannot be obtained using traditional technologies. Several methods have been proposed to decipher the spatial context of spots in tissue using spatial information. However, when spatial information and gene expression profiles are integrated, most methods only consider the local similarity of spatial information. As they do not consider the global semantic structure, spatial domain identification methods encounter poor or over-smoothed clusters. We developed ConSpaS, a novel node representation learning framework that precisely deciphers spatial domains by integrating local and global similarities based on graph autoencoder (GAE) and contrastive learning (CL). The GAE effectively integrates spatial information using local similarity and gene expression profiles, thereby ensuring that cluster assignment is spatially continuous. To improve the characterization of the global similarity of gene expression data, we adopt CL to consider the global semantic information. We propose an augmentation-free mechanism to construct global positive samples and use a semi-easy sampling strategy to define negative samples. We validated ConSpaS on multiple tissue types and technology platforms by comparing it with existing typical methods. The experimental results confirmed that ConSpaS effectively improved the identification accuracy of spatial domains with biologically meaningful spatial patterns, and denoised gene expression data while maintaining the spatial expression pattern.

In the tissue microenvironment, one type of cells could be divided into multiple cell subgroups that function differently and communicate with other cell types or subgroups via different ligand-receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Given two cell types, we define a cell sub-crosstalk pair (CSCP) as a combination of two cell subgroups with strong and similar intercellular crosstalk signals and identify CSCPs based on coupled non-negative matrix factorization. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics data of mouse olfactory bulb and visual cortex, we find that cells of different types within CSCPs are significantly spatially closer with each other than those in the whole single-cell spatial map. To demonstrate the utility of CSCPs, we apply 13 cell-cell communication analysis methods to sampled single-cell transcriptomics datasets at CSCP level and reveal ligand-receptor interactions masked at cell type level. Furthermore, by analyzing single-cell transcriptomics data from 29 breast cancer patients with different immunotherapy responses, we find that CSCPs are useful predictive features to discriminate patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy from non-responders. Taken together, partitioning a cell type pair into CSCPs enables fine-grained characterization of cell-cell communication in tissue and tumor microenvironments.","[Zhang, Chenxing; Hu, Yuxuan; Gao, Lin] Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Gao, L (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.",lgao@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"zhang, chenxing/HNS-8302-2023; Gao, Lin/JNF-0375-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62132015, U22A2037, 62002277]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YJS2205]; Innovation Fund of Xidian University [YJS2205]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Innovation Fund of Xidian University,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [62132015 and U22A2037 to L.G., 62002277 to Y.H.]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YJS2205]; the Innovation Fund of Xidian University [YJS2205].",,78,0,0,2,2,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,SEP 21,2023,13.0,1,,,,,,,15746,10.1038/s41598-023-42883-8,0.0,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,T1NW4,37735248.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001075732600093,0

The number and placement of the valves are optimised from clustering perspective with the Leiden algorithm. The optimal settings of the valves are determined with a differential evolution algorithm, where a compound fitness function is applied. On the one hand, it minimises the leakages, on the other hand, evades the pressure-dependent consumer outages, i.e. it keeps the pressure above the desired. Seven real-life water distribution networks were analysed from the region of Western Hungary using the techniques. Moreover, three of them are analysed in details.

As they explore the entire network, global methods suffer from severe limitations when handling large networks due to their time and space complexity. Local community detection methods are based on an egocentric function aiming to find only the community containing a query node (or set of query nodes). However, existing local methods are often sensitive to which query node(s) is used to discover a particular community. Our proposed approach, called SIWO Strong In, Weak Out, is a novel community detection method, which can locally discover densely-connected communities precisely, deterministically, and quickly. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that the detected community is not dependent on the initial query node within a community. This method works in a one-node-expansion way based on the notions of strong and weak links in a graph. In short, SIWO starts with a community consisting only of the query node(s). Then it checks the set of nodes in the community's neighborhood in each step to add the best node and finally returns the desired community around the given query node. It can also be used iteratively to detect the entire partitioning of a network with or without considering overlapping communities, and concurrently identify outliers that may not belong in any community. Moreover, as it does not store the entire graph into main memory, it can also be used to find the core of a community on very large networks, while there is limited time and memory available. Finally, SIWO is also able to handle weighted graphs, making SIWO a general framework for community discovery and detection in various type of social networks.","[Zafarmand, Mohammadmahdi; Talebirad, Yashar; Austin, Eric; Zaiane, Osmar R.] Univ Alberta, Alberta Machine Intelligence Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Largeron, Christine] Univ Jean Monnet, Hubert Curien Lab, St Etienne, France",University of Alberta,"Za√Øane, OR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Machine Intelligence Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada.;Largeron, C (corresponding author), Univ Jean Monnet, Hubert Curien Lab, St Etienne, France.",m.zafarmand@ualberta.ca; talebira@ualberta.ca; eaustin@ualberta.ca; largeron@univ-st-etienne.fr; zaiane@ualberta.ca,"Zaiane, Osmar R/KIA-3435-2024","Zaiane, Osmar R/0000-0002-0060-5988",Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute; Laboratoire Hubert Curien; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research,Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute; Laboratoire Hubert Curien(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)),"Funding were provided by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute, Laboratoire Hubert Curien and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.",,66,2,2,1,3,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",1869-5450,1869-5469,,SOC NETW ANAL MIN,Soc.

Here, we propose a general framework for dismantling that prioritizes the removal of nodes that bridge together different network communities. The strategies we detect are not unique, as they depend on the specific realization of the community detection algorithm considered. However, when applying the methodology to some synthetic benchmark and real-world networks we find that the dismantling performances are strongly robust, and do not depend on the specific algorithm. Thus, the stochasticity inherently present in many community detection algorithms allows to identify several strategies that have comparable effectiveness but require the removal of distinct subsets of nodes. This feature is highly relevant in operational contexts in which the removal of nodes is costly and allows to identify the least expensive strategy that still holds high effectiveness.","[Musciotto, F.; Micciche, S.] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim Emilio Segre, Viale Sci Ed 18, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Musciotto, F (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim Emilio Segre, Viale Sci Ed 18, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",musci8@gmail.com,"Miccich√®, Salvatore/B-6575-2008","Miccich√®, Salvatore/0000-0003-3779-592X",,,,,37,2,2,3,9,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,SEP 2,2023,13.0,1,,,,,,,14448,10.1038/s41598-023-40867-2,0.0,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,W0ZB7,37660149.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001088987000005,0

In the scAce method, we develop an adaptive cluster merging approach which achieves improved clustering results without the need to estimate the number of clusters in advance. In addition, scAce provides an option to perform clustering enhancement, which can update and enhance cluster assignments based on previous clustering results from other methods.

In order to improve the stability and accuracy of stochastic competitive learning and solve the problem of community detection, we propose an unsupervised community detection algorithm LNSSCL (Local Node Similarity-Integrated Stochastic Competitive Learning). The algorithm calculates node degree as well as Salton similarity metrics to determine the starting position of particle walk; local node similarity is incorporated into the particle preferential walk rule; the particle is dynamically adjusted to control capability increments according to the control range; particles select the node with the strongest control capability within the node to be resurrected; and the LNSSCL algorithm introduces a node affiliation selection step to adjust the node community labels. Experimental comparisons with 12 representative community detection algorithms on real network datasets and synthetic networks show that the LNSSCL algorithm is overall better than other compared algorithms in terms of standardized mutual information (NMI) and modularity (Q).

The execution time and computational resources demanded by these algorithms pose limitations when confronted with large datasets. Community detection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying groups and communities within intricate networks. To overcome the challenge of extensive computing resources with matrix factorization techniques, we present a novel framework that utilizes the inherent community information of the rating network. Our proposed approach, named Community-Based Matrix Factorization (CBMF), has the following steps: (1) Model the rating network as a complex bipartite network. (2) Divide the network into communities. (3) Extract the rating matrices pertaining only to those communities and apply MF on these matrices in parallel. (4) Merge the predicted rating matrices belonging to communities and evaluate the root mean square error (RMSE). In our experimentation, we use basic MF, SVD++, and FANMF for matrix factorization, and the Louvain algorithm is used for community division. The experimental evaluation on six datasets shows that the proposed CBMF enhances the quality of recommendations in each case. In the MovieLens 100K dataset, RMSE has been reduced to 0.21 from 1.26 using SVD++ by dividing the network into 25 communities. A similar reduction in RMSE is observed for the datasets of FilmTrust, Jester, Wikilens, Good Books, and Cell Phone.","[Tokala, Srilatha; Enduri, Murali Krishna; Lakshmi, T.

Current provider-focused interventions are implemented at the federal, state, regional, and local levels but have not slowed the epidemic. Certain targeted interventions aimed at opioid prescribers rely on populations defined along geographic, political, or administrative boundaries; however, those boundaries may not align well with actual provider-patient communities or with the geographic distribution of high-risk opioid use. Instead of relying exclusively on commonly used geographic and administrative boundaries, we suggest augmenting existing strategies with a social network-based approach to identify communities (or clusters) of providers that prescribe to the same set of patients as another mechanism for targeting certain interventions. To test this approach, we analyze 1 year of prescription data from a commercially insured population in the state of Indiana. The composition of inferred clusters is compared to Indiana's Public Health Preparedness Districts (PHPDs). We find that in some cases the correspondence between provider networks and PHPDs is very high, while in other cases the overlap is low. This has implications for whether an intervention is reaching its intended provider targets efficiently and effectively. Assessing the best intervention targeting strategy for a particular outcome could facilitate more effective interventions to tackle the ongoing opioid use epidemic.","[Kaminski, Patrick; Perry, Brea L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Green Jr, Harold D.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kaminski, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA.;Kaminski, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA.",pckamins@indiana.edu,,,"Special thanks to Alexander Gates for helpful discussions of the clustering similarity method, S.

Using ATAC-seq to identify HIV-1 DNA, ASAP-seq captured transcription factor activity and surface protein expression of HIV-1 DNA+ cells.

To identify reproducible biological insights and authentic HIV-1-infected cells and avoid false-positive discovery of artifacts, we reviewed current practices of single-cell multiomic experimental design and bioinformatic analysis.Single-cell multiomic approaches may identify innovative mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence, nominate therapeutic strategies, and accelerate discoveries.","[Wong, Michelle; Wei, Yulong; Ho, Ya-Chi] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis, New Haven, CT USA; [Ho, Ya-Chi] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Ho, YC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",ya-chi.ho@yale.edu,,,"NIH [R01 AI141009, R01 AI174863, R61/R33 DA047037, P01 AI169768, R37 AI147868, R01 DA051906, R01 AI145164, UM1 DA051410, U01 DA053628, P50 AI150464, UM1 AI164565, UM1 UM1 AI164570]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [PDF557234]; AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant,"This work is supported by Yale Top Scholar, NIH R01 AI141009, NIH R01 AI174863, NIH R61/R33 DA047037, NIH P01 AI169768, NIH R37 AI147868, NIH R01 DA051906, NIH R01 AI145164, NIH UM1 DA051410, NIH U01 DA053628, NIH CHEETAH P50 AI150464, NIH REACH Martin Delaney Collaboratory UM1 AI164565, NIH BEAT-HIV Martin Delaney Collaboratory UM1 UM1 AI164570, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-doctoral Fellowship (PDF557234) (Y.W.), AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant (Y.W.).",,103,1,2,4,17,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1746-630X,1746-6318,,CURR OPIN HIV AIDS,Curr.

Specifically, despite their appealing applications, community detection algorithms expose personal relationships that might be misused against social network members. This concern has opened a new research area called community deception, which is about hiding the members of a target community from community detection algorithms. State-of-the-art deception methods only look at how community members must perform edge updates to guarantee some level of hiding. This article introduces node-centric deception, a novel approach considering nodes entering and leaving a target community. We theoretically study the effect of node updates by leveraging node safeness as a deception optimization function. Based on this analysis, we present an effective heuristic capable of hiding the target community with minimal node operations. We evaluated our approach against several community detection algorithms and compared it with state-of-the-art deception algorithms with encouraging results.","[Madi, Saif Aldeen] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Sci, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Pirro, Giuseppe] Univ Calabria, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-87046 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Calabria,"Pirro, G (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-87046 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",madi@di.uniroma1.it; giuseppe.pirro@unical.it,,"Madi, Saif Aldeen/0000-0003-0336-6131; Pirro, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7499-5798",,,,,30,0,0,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

We study the evolutionary processes of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasars and the underlying physical processes, such as star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, through the application of Graph Theoretical analysis tools. We extract, process and analyze mid-infrared spectra of local (z < 0.4) ULIRGs and quasars between 5-38 mu m through internally developed Python routines, in order to generate similarity graphs, with the nodes representing ULIRGs being grouped together based on the similarity of their spectra. Additionally, we extract and compare physical features from the mid-IR spectra, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission and silicate depth absorption features, as indicators of the presence of star-forming regions and obscuring dust, in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of each evolutionary stage of ULIRGs. Our analysis identifies five groups of local ULIRGs based on their mid-IR spectra, which is quite consistent with the well established fork classification diagram by providing a higher level classification. We demonstrate how graph clustering algorithms and network analysis tools can be utilized as unsupervised learning techniques for revealing direct or indirect relations between various galaxy properties and evolutionary stages, which provides an alternative methodology to previous works for classification in galaxy evolution. Additionally, our methodology compares the output of several graph clustering algorithms in order to demonstrate the best-performing Graph Theoretical tools for studying galaxy evolution.

MATT cells are assigned crucial roles in regulating immunity and inflammation, yet their role in liver cancer remains elusive. Here, we present a MATT cell-centered profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and co-detection by indexing (CODEX) imaging of paired patient samples. These analyses highlight the heterogeneity and dysfunctionality of MATT cells in HCC and their defective capacity to infiltrate liver tumors. Machine-learning tools were used to dissect the spatial cellular interaction network within the MATT cell neighborhood. Co-localization in the adjacent liver and interaction between niche-occupying CSF1R+PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MATT cells was identified as a key regulatory element of MATT cell dysfunction. Perturbation of this cell-cell interaction in ex vivo co-culture studies using patient samples and murine models reinvigorated MATT cell cytotoxicity. These studies suggest that aPD-1/aPD-L1 therapies target MATT cells in HCC patients.","[Ruf, Benjamin; Benmebarek, Mohamed-Reda; Ma, Chi; Heinrich, Bernd; Subramanyam, Varun; Qi, Jonathan; Wabitsch, Simon;

As the state-of-the-art APC technology, the Shell-Yokogawa Platform for Advanced Control and Estimation (PACE) has adopted a systematic framework of handling dynamic optimization of largescale systems, where an automatic decomposition procedure generates subsystems for distributed MPC. The decomposition is implemented on network representations of the MPC models that capture interactions among process variables, with community detection used to maximize the statistical significance of the subnetworks with preferred internal interconnections.

By obtaining the device type of the target can assist in target IP geolocation or IP landmark mining. Most traditional rule -based or learning-based methods identify network entities. However, due to the existence of firewalls and the limitations of feature detection, the features of individual targets are prone to be missing or spoofed, which can lead to a decrease in the accuracy of network entity identification (NEI). This paper propose a graph neural network-based network entity identification method, GraphNEI model, which embeds network entities into the graph structure and uses graph neural networks to improve the current problem of missing or spoofed features in order to improve the accuracy of current network entity identification. It mainly includes five steps: data processing, subgraph partition, weight calculation, node update and classification. First, the acquired dataset is subjected to feature extraction and anonymization; second, the target nodes are subjected to network topology graph construction and community division; third, the nodes' self-attention, structural attention and similarity of neighbors are combined and used to calculate the nodes' combined attention; fourth, node aggregation and update, and update the node representation based on the combined attention results; finally, the nodes are classified. We successfully identified 7 different network entities on the publicly collected dataset, and the identification accuracy of network entities is above 95.49%, improved 0.51%-10.42% compared to typical rule-based or learning-based methods. It effectively improves the effective NEI in the absence of network entity features. In addition, we conduct IP geolocation research based on NEI, and the experimental results show that the method is effective in reducing IP geolocation errors distance.","[Ma, Zhaorui; Li, Na; Zhou, Qinglei; Liu, Fenlin] Henan Key Lab Cyberspace Situat Awareness, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zhaorui; Zhang, Shicheng; Li, Tianao; Hu, Xinhao; Feng, Hao; Wang, Hongjian; Zhang, Shubo; Zhai, Yaqi; Chen, Shuaibin; Zhang, Shuaiwei] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Li, Na] Sias Univ, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Quan, Xiaowen] WebRAY Info Co Ltd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zhaorui; Hu, Guangwu] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 517200, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University of Light Industry; Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology,"Zhang, SC (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.;Hu, GW (corresponding author), Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 517200, Peoples R China.",zhangshicheng@email.zzuli.edu.cn; hugw@sziit.edu.cn,"chen, shuo bing/KHV-7129-2024; LI, yue/KHC-6771-2024; liu, qi/KHC-7509-2024; WANG, SHIHAO/KHC-8263-2024","Zhang, Shicheng/0009-0004-6043-0851",key scientific research project plans of higher education institutions in Henan Province [2022A1515010417]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Founda-tion [JSGG20211029095545002]; Key Project of Shenzhen Municipal-ity; [21zx014],key scientific research project plans of higher education institutions in Henan Province; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Founda-tion; Key Project of Shenzhen Municipal-ity;,"Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by the key scientific research project plans of higher education institutions in Henan Province (Grant No. 21zx014) , Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Founda-tion (No. 2022A1515010417) , and Key Project of Shenzhen Municipal-ity (No. JSGG20211029095545002) .

This opens epistemological questions regarding our ontology and models, and some pointers will be given to how natural language processing (NLP) may help overcome our cognitive limitations for understanding single-cell data.","[Mihai, Ionut Sebastian; Chafle, Sarang; Henriksson, Johan] Lab Mol Infect Med Sweden MIMS, Umea, Sweden; [Mihai, Ionut Sebastian; Chafle, Sarang; Henriksson, Johan] Umea Univ, Umea Ctr Microbial Res UCMR, Dept Mol Biol, Umea, Sweden; [Mihai, Ionut Sebastian] Umea Univ, Ind Doctoral Sch, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University,"Henriksson, J (corresponding author), Lab Mol Infect Med Sweden MIMS, Umea, Sweden.;Henriksson, J (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Umea Ctr Microbial Res UCMR, Dept Mol Biol, Umea, Sweden.",ionut.sebastian.mihai@umu.se; sarang.chafle@gmail.com; johan.henriksson@umu.se,"Henriksson, Johan/ABD-2430-2021","Henriksson, Johan/0000-0002-7745-2844; Chafle, Sarang/0000-0003-2475-3528",Umea University; Umea industrial doctoral school (Foeretagsforskarskolan) of Umea university; Sartorius; Vetenskapsradet [202106602],Umea University; Umea industrial doctoral school (Foeretagsforskarskolan) of Umea university; Sartorius; Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council),"Open access funding provided by Umea University.

Over the years, a large number of papers have been published, resulting in the development of various community detection algorithms that consider factors such as the type of networks, the nature of communities, and applications. Despite numerous relevant review and survey papers, the literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of existing community detection algorithms. This review aims to address this gap by providing a more detailed analysis and evaluation of the computational complexity of hierarchical clustering algorithms for community detection, including two main categories: agglomerative and divisive algorithms. We also highlight the main theoretical concepts, emphasizing the benets and drawbacks of each approach, both in theory and in practical applications. This review helps researchers and practitioners in this eld better understand valuable information on the di (R) erences and unique features of community detection algorithms with hierarchical community structure.","[Bui, Van Hieu] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland; [Bui, Van Hieu] Hue Univ, Hue City, Vietnam; [Phan, Huyen Trang] Nguyen Tat Thanh Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Hue University; Nguyen Tat Thanh University (NTTU),"Bui, VH (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland.;Bui, VH (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Hue City, Vietnam.",hieu.bui-van@pwr.edu.pl; huyentrangtin@gmail.com,,"Bui, Van Hieu/0000-0002-1931-0805",,,,,72,1,1,12,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2196-8888,2196-8896,,VIETNAM J COMPUT SCI,Vietnam J.

This study conducted a quantitative review of 327 peer-reviewed esports publications. By analyzing the keywords, identifying research themes of those keywords (i.e. communities), and plotting these communities on a strategic diagram, this study found evidence that esports research is in its infancy and is highly interdisciplinary. The year of the earliest esports publications and the strategic diagram demonstrates that research in esports has not matured. The analysis of the communities demonstrates that many of the research themes were related to more than one discipline. Finally, this study refines the definitions of esports by identifying its central components based on the co-word analysis and comparing it to the esports literature.

Currently, the common practice in scRNA-seq is to determine cell type labels through unsupervised clustering and the examination of cluster-specific genes. However, even small differences in analysis and parameter choosing can greatly alter clustering results and thus impose great influence on which cell types are identified. Existing methods largely focus on determining the optimal number of robust clusters, which can be problematic for identifying cells of extremely low abundance due to their subtle contributions toward overall patterns of gene expression.Results: Here, we present a carefully designed framework, SCISSORS, which accurately profiles subclusters within broad cluster(s) for the identification of rare cell types in scRNA-seq data. SCISSORS employs silhouette scoring for the estimation of heterogeneity of clusters and reveals rare cells in heterogenous clusters by a multi-step semi-supervised reclustering process. Additionally, SCISSORS provides a method for the identification of marker genes of high specificity to the cell type.

The critical tasks in ScRNA-seq data analysis are clustering and dimensionality reduction. Recent deep clustering algorithms are used to optimize the two tasks jointly, and their variations, graph-based deep clustering algorithms, are used to capture and preserve topological information in the process. However, the existing graph-based deep clustering algorithms ignore the distribution information of nodes when constructing cell graphs which leads to incomplete information in the embedding representation; and graph convolutional networks (GCN), which are most commonly used, often suffer from over-smoothing that leads to high sample similarity in the embedding representation and then poor clustering performance. Here, the dual-GCN-based deep clustering with Triplet contrast (scDGDC) is proposed for dimensionality reduction and clustering of scRNA-seq data. Two critical components are dual-GCN-based encoder for capturing more comprehensive topological information and triplet contrast for reducing GCN over-smoothing. The two components improve the dimensionality reduction and clustering performance of scDGDC in terms of information acquisition and model optimization, respectively. The experiments on eight real ScRNA-seq datasets showed that scDGDC achieves excellent performance for both clustering and dimensionality reduction tasks and is high robustness to parameters.","[Wang, Linjie; Xie, Weidong; Wang, Rui] Northeastern Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp Med Image MIIC, Shenyang 110000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kun] Northeastern Univ, Coll Med & Bioinformat Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China,"Li, W (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp Med Image MIIC, Shenyang 110000, Peoples R China.",2110696@stu.neu.edu.cn; liwei@cse.neu.edu.cn; 1910638@stu.neu.edu.cn; 2101806@stu.neu.edu.cn; yukun@bmie.neu.edu.cn,"Yu, Kun/GQY-9364-2022","Min, Xin/0000-0002-1996-7241; Wang, LinJie/0009-0004-2028-7501","National key research and development program, China [2022JH2/101300075]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [B16009]; National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project; [2021YFC2701003]","National key research and development program, China; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province); National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project;","?This work was supported by the research project funded by National key research and development program, China (2021YFC2701003) , Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province under grant (2022JH2/101300075) , the National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project (B16009) .",,55,1,1,9,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1476-9271,1476-928X,,COMPUT BIOL CHEM,Comput.

Then, the scenario-oriented travel communities that can reflect the distinctive urban regional mobility are detected. From the result, four kinds of travel scenarios are recognized, where the difference of metro service coverage towards access and egress FFB trips is further discussed. Moreover, by analyzing the development of the travel communities, we reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of urban regional mobility.

This, together with the emergence of platforms such as Wikipedia, has challenged traditional views on the relationship between current events and historical accounts of events, with an ever-shrinking divide between news and history. Wikipedia's place as the Internet's primary reference work thus poses the question of how it represents both traditional encyclopaedic knowledge and evolving important news stories. In other words, how is information on and attention towards current events integrated into the existing topical structures of Wikipedia? To address this, we develop a temporal community detection approach towards topic detection that takes into account both short term dynamics of attention as well as long term article network structures. We apply this method to a dataset of one year of current events on Wikipedia to identify clusters of Wikipedia articles related to news events, distinct from those that would be found solely from page view time series correlations or static network structure. We are able to resolve the topics that more strongly reflect unfolding current events vs more established knowledge by the relative importance of collective attention dynamics vs link structures. We also offer important developments by identifying and describing the emergent topics on Wikipedia. This work provides a means of distinguishing how these information and attention clusters are related to Wikipedia's twin faces of encyclopaedic knowledge and current events-crucial to understanding the production and consumption of knowledge in the digital age.","[Gildersleve, Patrick] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lambiotte, Renaud] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Yasseri, Taha] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Sociol, Dublin, Ireland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University College Dublin,"Gildersleve, P (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.gildersleve@lse.ac.uk,"Lambiotte, Renaud/C-1085-2009","Lambiotte, Renaud/0000-0002-0583-4595; Yasseri, Taha/0000-0002-1800-6094",,,,,100,1,1,4,6,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2432-2717,2432-2725,,J COMPUT SOC SCI,J.

As a diversity preservation strategy customized for evolutionary algorithms (EAs), niching has been extensively incorporated into many algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, many existing niching techniques require pre-defined parameters to control the size or number of niches, making the algorithm sensitive to parameters. Taking individuals as nodes, the inverse distance of two individuals as edges, and the historical information of recent generations as node attributes, we can construct a population as a network, whose purpose is to divide niches through community detection without relying on sensitive parameters. Inspired by this idea, this paper proposes a network community-based differential evolution for multimodal optimization problems (NetCDEMMOPs). In NetCDEMMOPs , three strategies are proposed and work together. Firstly, the community detection-based niching (CDN) strategy constructs the population as an attribute network and automatically divides it into multiple niches without sensitive parameters. Secondly, the community elites-based updating (CEU) strategy allocates more evolutionary resources to elite individuals of communities, then predicts and updates these elites based on historical information. Finally, the poor individual remolding (PIR) strategy remolds the last-ranking individuals and guides them toward promising positions. After extensive experimentation with the widely adopted CEC'2013 test suit, the experimental results reveal the superiority of NetCDEMMOPs over many successful or recent algorithms for MMOPs.","[Chen, Xi-Yuan; Zhao, Hong; Liu, Jing] Xidian Univ, Guangzhou Inst Technol, Ghuangzhou, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Zhao, H (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Guangzhou Inst Technol, Ghuangzhou, Peoples R China.",hongzhao@xidian.edu.cn,,"Chen, Xiyuan/0000-0003-4631-3232","Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021A151511073, 2022A1515011297, 202201011236]; Guangdong High-level Innovation Research Institution Project [2021B0909050008]; Guangzhou Key Research and Development Program [202206030003]",Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Guangdong High-level Innovation Research Institution Project; Guangzhou Key Research and Development Program,"* This work was supported in part by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A151511073, 2022A1515011297, 202201011236) , in part by the Guangdong High-level Innovation Research Institution Project (2021B0909050008) , in part by the Guangzhou Key Research and Development Program (202206030003) .",,50,2,2,8,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0020-0255,1872-6291,,INFORM SCIENCES,Inf.

Data integration is a crucial step in most scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines involving multiple batches. It improves data visualization, batch effect reduction, clustering, label transfer, and cell type inference. Many data integration tools have been proposed during the last decade, but a surge in the number of these methods has made it difficult to pick one for a given use case. Furthermore, these tools are provided as rigid pieces of software, making it hard to adapt them to various specific scenarios. In order to address both of these issues at once, we introduce the transmorph framework. It allows the user to engineer powerful data integration pipelines and is supported by a rich software ecosystem. We demonstrate transmorph usefulness by solving a variety of practical challenges on scRNA-seq datasets including joint datasets embedding, gene space integration, and transfer of cycle phase annotations. transmorph is provided as an open source python package.","[Fouche, Aziz; Chadoutaud, Loic; Zinovyev, Andrei] PSL Res Univ, Inst Curie, F-75005 Paris, France; [Fouche, Aziz; Chadoutaud, Loic; Zinovyev, Andrei] INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Fouche, Aziz; Chadoutaud, Loic; Zinovyev, Andrei] PSL Res Univ, CBIO Ctr Computat Biol, MINES ParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Fouche, Aziz] Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Delattre, Olivier] Inst Curie, SIREDO Oncol Ctr, Equipe Labellisee LNCC, INSERM U830, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zinovyev, Andrei] Evotec, In Sil R&D, F-31400 Toulouse, France",UNICANCER; Universite PSL; Institut Curie; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Universite PSL; UNICANCER; Institut Curie; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Evotec,"Fouch√©, A; Zinovyev, A (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Inst Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.;Fouch√©, A; Zinovyev, A (corresponding author), INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France.;Fouch√©, A; Zinovyev, A (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, CBIO Ctr Computat Biol, MINES ParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France.;Fouch√©, A (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Zinovyev, A (corresponding author), Evotec, In Sil R&D, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",aziz.fouche@curie.fr; andrei.zinovyev@curie.fr,"Zinovyev, Andrei/B-4715-2010","Zinovyev, Andrei/0000-0002-9517-7284",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PRAIRIE 3IA Institute) [ANR-19-P3IA-0001]; European Union [826121],Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PRAIRIE 3IA Institute)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"French government under the management of Agence Nationale de la Recherche as part of the Investissements d'avenir' program [ANR-19-P3IA-0001] (PRAIRIE 3IA Institute); European Union's Horizon 2020 program [826121, iPC project].",,39,1,1,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2631-9268,,NAR GENOM BIOINFORM,NAR Genom.

In cryptocurrency transaction networks, community detection can help identify users that are most related to known illegal users. However, there are challenges in applying community detection in cryptocurrency transaction networks: (1) the use of pseudonymous addresses that are not directly linked to personal information make it difficult to interpret the detected communities; (2) on Bitcoin, a user usually owns multiple Bitcoin addresses, and nodes in transaction networks do not always represent users. Existing works on cluster analysis on Bitcoin transaction networks focus on addressing the later using different heuristics to cluster addresses that are controlled by the same user. This research focuses on illegal community detection containing one or more illegal Bitcoin addresses. We first investigate the structure of Bitcoin transaction networks and suitable community detection methods, then collect a set of illegal addresses and use them to label the detected communities. The results show that 0.06% of communities from daily transaction networks contain one or more illegal addresses when 2,313,344 illegal addresses are used to label the communities. The results also show that distance-based clustering methods and other methods depending on them, such as network representation learning, are not suitable for Bitcoin transaction networks while community quality optimization and label-propagation-based methods are the most suitable.","[Kamuhanda, Dany; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kamuhanda, Dany; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technol Grp, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kamuhanda, Dany] Univ Rwanda, Coll Educ, Dept Math Sci & Phys Educ, POB 55, Rwamagana, Rwanda; [Cui, Mengtian] Southwest Minzu Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610040, Peoples R China",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Rwanda; Southwest Minzu University,"Tessone, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.;Tessone, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technol Grp, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",dany.kamuhanda@uzh.ch; mengtian.cui@swun.edu.cn; claudio.tessone@uzh.ch,"KAMUHANDA, Dany DK/I-3980-2016",,Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2023YFH0057]; Foreign Talents Program of Ministry of China [G2022186003L],Sichuan Science and Technology Program; Foreign Talents Program of Ministry of China,"This research was funded by Sichuan Science and Technology Program (Grant No. 2023YFH0057), Foreign Talents Program of Ministry of China (Grant No. G2022186003L).",,51,0,0,5,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,JUL,2023,25.0,7,,,,,,,1069,10.3390/e25071069,0.0,,,14,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,N7GX5,37510016.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:001038663100001,0

Several insights derive from chromosome capture methods, such as Hi-C, which allow researchers to construct contact maps depicting 3D interactions among all DNA segment pairs. These maps show a complex cross-scale organization spanning megabase-pair compartments to short-ranged DNA loops. To better understand the organizing principles, several groups analyzed Hi-C data assuming a Russian-doll-like nested hierarchy where DNA regions of similar sizes merge into larger and larger structures. Apart from being a simple and appealing description, this model explains, e.g., the omnipresent chequerboard pattern seen in Hi-C maps, known as A/B compartments, and foreshadows the co-localization of some functionally similar DNA regions. However, while successful, this model is incompatible with the two competing mechanisms that seem to shape a significant part of the chromosomes' 3D organization: loop extrusion and phase separation. This paper aims to map out the chromosome's actual folding hierarchy from empirical data. To this end, we take advantage of Hi-C experiments and treat the measured DNA-DNA interactions as a weighted network. From such a network, we extract 3D communities using the generalized Louvain algorithm. This algorithm has a resolution parameter that allows us to scan seamlessly through the community size spectrum, from A/B compartments to topologically associated domains (TADs). By constructing a hierarchical tree connecting these communities, we find that chromosomes are more complex than a perfect hierarchy. Analyzing how communities nest relative to a simple folding model, we found that chromosomes exhibit a significant portion of nested and non-nested community pairs alongside considerable randomness. In addition, by examining nesting and chromatin types, we discovered that nested parts are often associated with active chromatin. These results highlight that cross-scale relationships will be essential components in models aiming to reach a deep understanding of the causal mechanisms of chromosome folding. Author summaryThe 3D organization of mammalian DNA affects genetic processes, such as transcription, DNA repair, and epigenetics. To unravel the complexity of the 3D structure, researchers developed numerous experimental methods, the most advanced being Hi-C. This method enables scientists to create contact maps illustrating the 3D interactions among all pairs of DNA segments across the genome. These maps unveiled a multi-scale organization, ranging from megabase-pair compartments to short-range DNA loops. Common explanations for this organization rest on nested hierarchies, where DNA regions of similar sizes coalesce into larger structures. However, such a model is incompatible with competing molecular mechanisms, primarily loop extrusion and phase separation, that shape the chromosomes' 3D organization at different scales.Our study aims to map out the actual chromosome folding relationships using Hi-C data sets. Treating the data as a weighted network of DNA-DNA interactions, we identified 3D communities across different network scales using the Generalized Louvain method, a standard community detection algorithm. By building a tree linking these communities, we discovered that chromosome organization is more intricate than a perfect hierarchy suggests. Instead, we found that chromosomes exhibit a mix of nested and non-nested community pairs alongside considerable randomness. The nested parts often associate with active chromatin. These results highlight that cross-scale relationships are critical for understanding the causal mechanisms of chromosome folding.","[Bernenko, Dolores; Lizana, Ludvig] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Jinju, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Res Inst Nat Sci, Jinju, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju, South Korea; [Stenberg, Per] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University; Umea University,"Lizana, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden.",ludvig.lizana@umu.se,,"Lee, Sang Hoon/0000-0003-3079-5679; Lizana, Ludvig/0000-0003-3174-8145","National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2021R1C1C1004132, NRF-2022R1A4A1030660]; Swedish Research Council [2017-03848, 2021-04080]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation [2014-0018]; Swedish Research Council [2021-04080, 2017-03848] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council",National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"We acknowledge financial support from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea (S.H.L. grant Nos.

Networks of organisms at different spatial scales and in different ecosystems have provided insights into community assembly patterns and emergent properties of ecological systems. In the present work, we investigate two questions pertaining to fish species assembly rules in US river basins, a) if morphologically similar fish species also tend to be phylogenetically closer, and b) to what extent are co-occurring species that are phylogenetically close also morphologically similar? For the first question, we construct a network of Hydrologic Unit Code 8 (HUC8) regions as nodes with interaction strengths (edges) governed by the number of common species. For each of the modules of this network, which are found to be geographically separated, there is differential yet significant evidence that phylogenetic distance predicts morphological distance. For the second question, we construct and analyze nearest neighbor directed networks of species based on their morphological distances and phylogenetic distances. Through module detection on these networks and comparing the module-level mean phylogenetic distance and mean morphological distance with the number of basins of common occurrence of species in modules, we find that both phylogeny and morphology of species have significant roles in governing species co-occurrence, i.e. phylogenetically and morphologically distant species tend to co-exist more. In addition, between the two quantities (morphological distance and phylogentic distance), we find that morphological distance is a stronger determinant of species co-occurrences.","[Tripathi, Richa; Mertel, Adam; Su, Guohuan; Calabrese, Justin M.

In this study, we proposed a reaction network flow analysis/ community-based mechanism detection/target species selection integrated framework to simplify the reaction network and extract key reaction routes. The naphtha steam cracking reaction system was preliminarily selected as an industrial example. The auto-generated reaction network was simultaneously set as an input of the PageRank-based reaction network analysis tool and community detection algorithm based on modularity analysis. After recording the importance and community affiliation information of each node in the network, the simplified communities were obtained and considered as skeletal mechanisms divided by reaction categories.

With the influx of large-scale data sets from diverse modalities, the resolution achieved has supported the long-held notion that immune cells are naturally organized into hierarchical relationships, characterized at multiple levels. Such a multigranular structure corresponds to key geometric and topological features. Given that differences between an effective and ineffective immunological response may not be found at one level, there is vested interest in characterizing and predicting outcomes from such features. In this review, we highlight single cell methods and principles for learning geometric and topological properties of data at multiple scales, discussing their contributions to immunology.

High-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of single cells in their spatial context. However, summarizing the great diversity of complex cell shapes found in tissues and inferring associations with other single-cell data remains a challenge. Here, we present CAJAL, a general computational framework for the analysis and integration of single-cell morphological data. By building upon metric geometry, CAJAL infers cell morphology latent spaces where distances between points indicate the amount of physical deformation required to change the morphology of one cell into that of another. We show that cell morphology spaces facilitate the integration of single-cell morphological data across technologies and the inference of relations with other data, such as single-cell transcriptomic data. We demonstrate the utility of CAJAL with several morphological datasets of neurons and glia and identify genes associated with neuronal plasticity in C. elegans.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing offers the opportunity to detect such differential abundance patterns, yet this task can be statistically challenging due to the noise in single-cell data, inter-sample variability and because such patterns are often of small effect size. Here we present a differential abundance testing paradigm called ELVAR that uses cell attribute aware clustering when inferring differentially enriched communities within the single-cell manifold. Using simulated and real single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq datasets, we benchmark ELVAR against an analogous algorithm that uses Louvain for clustering, as well as local neighborhood-based methods, demonstrating that ELVAR improves the sensitivity to detect cell-type composition shifts in relation to aging, precancerous states and Covid-19 phenotypes. In effect, leveraging cell attribute information when inferring cell communities can denoise single-cell data, avoid the need for batch correction and help retrieve more robust cell states for subsequent differential abundance testing.

Inhibiting hyperactive kinases is a viable therapeutic strategy to treat different cancer types. Unfortunately for cancer therapy, kinase signalling networks are robust to external perturbations, thus allowing tumour cells to orchestrate mechanisms that compensate for inhibition of specific kinases. Therefore, there is a need to better understand kinase network structure to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we reconstructed kinase networks from phosphoproteomics data, and compared the activity of its kinase interactions in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. We then tested community detection algorithms to identify kinase components associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, a paradigmatic oncogenic signalling cascade. We found that TTK was usually grouped with networks derived for PI3K, AKT and mTOR kinases. Wet-lab experiments confirmed that TTK is likely to act downstream of AKT and mTOR. We thus showed that our methods can be used to identify potential new members of canonical kinase signalling cascades. Phosphoproteomics allows one to measure the activity of kinases that drive the fluxes of signal transduction pathways involved in biological processes such as immune function, senescence and cell growth. However, deriving knowledge of signalling network circuitry from these data is challenging due to a scarcity of phosphorylation sites that define kinase-kinase relationships. To address this issue, we previously identified around 6,000 phosphorylation sites as markers of kinase-kinase relationships (that may be conceptualised as network edges), from which empirical cell-model-specific weighted kinase networks may be reconstructed. Here, we assess whether the application of community detection algorithms to such networks can identify new components linked to canonical signalling pathways. Phosphoproteomics data from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells treated separately with PI3K, AKT, MEK and ERK inhibitors were used to reconstruct individual kinase networks. We used modularity maximisation to detect communities in each network, and selected the community containing the main target of the inhibitor used to treat cells. These analyses returned communities that contained known canonical signalling components. Interestingly, in addition to canonical PI3K/AKT/mTOR members, the community assignments returned TTK (also known as MPS1) as a likely component of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. We drew similar insights from an external phosphoproteomics dataset from breast cancer cells treated with rapamycin and oestrogen. We confirmed this observation with wet-lab laboratory experiments showing that TTK phosphorylation was decreased in AML cells treated with AKT and MTOR inhibitors. This study illustrates the application of community detection algorithms to the analysis of empirical kinase networks to uncover new members linked to canonical signalling pathways.","[Basanta, Celia De Los Angeles Colomina; Hijazi, Maruan; Cutillas, Pedro R.] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Cell Signaling & Proteom Grp, London, England; [Bazzi, Marya] Univ Warwick, Warwick Math Inst, Coventry, England; [Bazzi, Marya; Bessant, Conrad; Cutillas, Pedro R.] Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Bessant, Conrad] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Warwick; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Cutillas, PR (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Cell Signaling & Proteom Grp, London, England.;Bazzi, M (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Math Inst, Coventry, England.;Bazzi, M; Cutillas, PR (corresponding author), Alan Turing Inst, London, England.",Marya.Bazzi@warwick.ac.uk; p.cutillas@qmul.ac.uk,"Hijazi Vega, Maruan/AAH-7934-2019","Hijazi Vega, Maruan/0000-0003-0861-7577; Rodriguez Cutillas, Pedro/0000-0002-3426-2274; Colomina Basanta, Celia/0000-0001-7896-246X",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Alan Turing Institute [EP/T001569/1]; Blood Cancer UK [20008]; Cancer Research UK [C15966/A24375]; Medical Research Council [MR/R015686/1]; Barts and The London Charity [G-022151],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Alan Turing Institute(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Blood Cancer UK; Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Barts and The London Charity,"This work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, Grant EP/T001569/1) through the Alan Turing Institute (to PRC and MB) and Blood Cancer UK (20008).

These conditions make it easy to spread information from one user to another in close neighborhoods and around the whole social network located on the given platform. Unfortunately, it has recently been increasingly used for malicious purposes, e.g., rumor propagation. In most cases, the process starts from multiple nodes (users). There are numerous papers about detecting the real source with only one initiator. There is a lack of solutions dedicated to problems with multiple sources. Most solutions that meet those criteria need an accurate number of origins to detect them correctly, which is impossible to obtain in real-life usage.

Proposing a fast and accurate algorithm with low time complexity is vital for large-scale networks. In this paper, a fast community detection algorithm based on local balanced label diffusion (LBLD) is proposed. The LBLD algorithm starts with assigning node importance score to each node using a new local similarity measure. After that, top 5% important nodes are selected as initial rough cores to expand communities. In the first step, two neighbor nodes with highest similarity than others receive a same label. In the second step, based on the selected rough cores, the proposed algorithm diffuses labels in a balanced approach from both core and border nodes to expand communities. Next, a label selection step is performed to ensure that each node is surrendered by the most appropriate label. Finally, by utilizing a fast merge step, final communities are discovered. Besides, the proposed method not only has a fast convergence speed, but also provides stable and accurate results. Moreover, there is no randomness as well as adjustable parameter in the LBLD algorithm.

Nowadays, communities strongly overlap due to the fact that people strongly interact, which makes community detection even more challenging. The paper develops a new algorithm by rearranging 'indivisible' blocks (RaidB). In RaidB, we first initialize 'indivisible' blocks by disjoint k-clique blocks in a network, and then these blocks are rearranged by moving nodes from one block to another based on maximizing modularity to uncover non-overlapping communities. For identifying overlapping communities, the above blocks are further rearranged, i.e., each block is subdivided and expanded to determine sub-blocks by introducing a dynamic linear threshold (DLT) model for influence interpenetration, and we finally determine a division from these sub-blocks with the minimum size that can cover the network. We compare RaidB with the existing state of the art methods for non-overlapping and overlapping community detection. The results show that RaidB tends to achieve better performance especially on sparse networks with unobvious communities and networks with strongly overlapping communities.","[Sun, Peng Gang; Wu, Xunlian; Quan, Yining; Miao, Qiguang] Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Sun, PG (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.",psun@mail.xidian.edu.cn; xunlianwu@mail.xidian.edu.cn; ynquan@mai1.xidian.edu.cn; qgmiao@mai1.xidian.edu.cn,,"Wu, Xunlian/0000-0001-6398-6354; Miao, Qiguang/0000-0002-2872-388X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872432]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JB210303],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61872432 and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant JB210303.,,65,0,0,4,9,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1041-4347,1558-2191,,IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN,IEEE Trans.

An improved Leiden method based on the gravity model is used to construct a preliminary zoning scheme, which is then modified by spatial constraints. The modularity index demonstrates the suitability of this method for community detection. This method can minimize cut-off traffic flows between pandemic control areas. The results show that only 24.8% of travel links are disrupted using our method, which could reduce both the impact of pandemic control on the daily life of residents and its cost. These findings can help develop sustainable strategies and proposals for effective pandemic response.","[Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban T, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Hua, Mingzhuang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Gen Aviat & Flight, Liyang 213300, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuewu] Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Chen, XW (corresponding author), Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",chenxuewu@seu.edu.cn,"Hua, Mingzhuang/GRJ-5095-2022; Yufei, Wang/KFQ-7799-2024","Hua, Mingzhuang/0000-0002-1340-0164; Yufei, Wang/0000-0002-6326-7357",National Natural Science Foundation of China [52172316],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is sponsored by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (52172316) .

This novel tunable spatially aware strategy of SpaSRL not only balances spatial and transcriptional coherence for the two tasks, but also can transfer spatial correlation constraint between them based on a unified model. In addition, this joint analysis by SpaSRL deciphers accurate and fine-grained tissue structures and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative genes underlying spatial architecture. We verified the superiority of SpaSRL on spatial domain detection, spatial functional genes identification and data denoising using multiple SRT datasets obtained by different platforms and tissue sections.

However, integrating data from multiple modalities is challenging due to high dimensionality and diverse nature of data, and noise associated with each platform. Sparsity in data, non-overlapping features and technical batch effects make the task of learning more complicated. Conventional machine learning (ML) tools are not quite effective against such data integration hazards due to their simplistic nature with less capacity. In addition, existing methods for single cell multi-omics integration are computationally expensive. Therefore, in this work, we have introduced a novel Unsupervised neural network for single cell Multi-omics INTegration (UMINT). UMINT serves as a promising model for integrating variable number of single cell omics layers with high dimensions. It has a light-weight architecture with substantially reduced number of parameters. The proposed model is capable of learning a latent low-dimensional embedding that can extract useful features from the data facilitating further downstream analyses. UMINT has been applied to integrate healthy and disease CITE-seq (paired RNA and surface proteins) datasets including a rare disease Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) tumor. It has been benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art methods for single cell multi-omics integration. Furthermore, UMINT is capable of integrating paired single cell gene expression and ATAC-seq (Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) assays as well.","[Maitra, Chayan; De, Rajat K.] Indian Stat Inst, Machine Intelligence Unit, Kolkata, India; [Seal, Dibyendu B.] Tatras Data Serv Pvt Ltd, New Delhi, India; [Das, Vivek] Novo Nord AS, Malov, Denmark",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Novo Nordisk,"De, RK (corresponding author), Indian Stat Inst, Machine Intelligence Unit, Kolkata, India.;Das, V (corresponding author), Novo Nord AS, Malov, Denmark.",vivekdas.0687@gmail.com; rajat@isical.ac.in,,,DST-NSF,DST-NSF,"DS thanks the Data Science Laboratory, A.

Existing methods focus on functional connectivity within a single frequency band. However, it is well-known that higher order brain functions rely on the integration of information across oscillations at different frequencies. Therefore, there is a need to study these cross-frequency interactions. In this paper, we use multilayer networks to model functional connectivity across multiple frequencies, where each layer corresponds to a different frequency band. We then introduce the multilayer modularity metric to develop a multilayer community detection algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a study of error monitoring in the human brain. The differences between the community structures within and across different frequency bands for two response types, i.e. error and correct, are studied. The results indicate that following an error response, the brain organizes itself to form communities across frequencies, in particular between theta and gamma bands while a similar cross-frequency community formation is not observed following the correct response.","[Karaaslanli, Abdullah; Ortiz-Bouza, Meiby; Munia, Tamanna T.

Typical examples include online social net-works and ecology networks. While the identification of commu-nities bears numerous practical applications, with the increasing awareness of data security and privacy concerns, the need to protect the community affiliations of individuals from disclosing by attackers emerges. This raises the community deception (CD) problem, that is, the opposite of community detection, which asks for ways to minimally perturb the network structures by rewiring nodes so that the target communities maximally hide themself from community detection algorithms. To this end, we investigate the CD problem through a Laplacian spectrum lens and propose a method named ComDeceptor to hide a flexible target set of communities, which is more universal than most existing methods that either focus on hiding the entire communities or a single community. The key idea of ComDeceptor is to first allocate the resources of perturbations fairly and effectively. By proving that hiding communities through intercommunity edge addition and intracommunity edge deletion correspond to maximizing the second smallest eigenvalue ?(2) and minimizing the largest eigenvalue ?(n) of the graph Laplacian, respectively, ComDeceptor then incorporates efficient heuristics for approx-imately solving the problems, thus selecting the appropriate edge to perturb. Experimental results over nine real-world networks and six community detection algorithms not only demonstrate the efficiency of ComDeceptor, but also the superior performance on obfuscating community structures over the baselines.","[Zhang, Chong; Fu, Luoyi; Ding, Jiaxin; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xinde] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Long, Fei] Xinhua News Agcy, State Key Lab Media Convergence Prod Technol & Sys, Beijing 100077, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Jing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chenghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, XB (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zhangchong18@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; jiaxinding@sjtu.edu.cn; xdcao@sjtu.edu.cn; longf05@tsinghua.org.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; zhoulei1588@sjtu.edu.cn; zhangjing1010@sjtu.edu.cn; zhouch@Ireis.ac.cn,"CAO, ying/KFA-2972-2024; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024; Ding, Jiaxin/ACA-4233-2022; Long, Fei/ADM-0209-2022; xie, jing/KDO-9486-2024; zhang, lele/IWM-4398-2023; YANG, DAN/KCL-5217-2024; Wang, Weiyi/JZC-7841-2024; Cao, Xinde/I-7971-2015; wang, wenjing/KEH-0575-2024; Li, Bo/KHX-7246-2024; zhang, zheng/KHY-8870-2024; wang, wei/JYP-7819-2024; Wen, Jing/KCL-6614-2024; Liu, Xiaohan/KBB-4246-2024; ZHANG, JING/KHY-1073-2024; chen, xiao/KFQ-6812-2024; Zhou, Lei/G-5200-2010","Ding, Jiaxin/0000-0002-0009-9237; Long, Fei/0000-0002-8906-833X; Cao, Xinde/0000-0002-2315-4219; Liu, Xiaohan/0009-0009-5291-2494; Zhou, Chenghu/0000-0003-3331-2302; Zhou, Lei/0000-0002-0433-3991","NSF China [42050105, 62020106005, 62061146002, 61960206002]; 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader [18XD1401800]",NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader,"This work was supported in part by the NSF China under Grant 42050105, Grant 62020106005, Grant 62061146002, and Grant 61960206002; in part by the 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; in part by the Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; and in part by the Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader under Grant 18XD1401800.",,37,0,0,3,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

As a graph-based clustering method, CosTaL transforms the cells with high-dimensional features into a weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph. The cells are represented by the vertices of the graph, while an edge between two vertices in the graph represents the close relatedness between the two cells. Specifically, CosTaL builds an exact kNN graph using cosine similarity and uses the Tanimoto coefficient as the refining strategy to re-weight the edges in order to improve the effectiveness of clustering. We demonstrate that CosTaL generally achieves equivalent or higher effectiveness scores on seven benchmark cytometry datasets and six single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets using six different evaluation metrics, compared with other state-of-the-art graph-based clustering methods, including PhenoGraph, Scanpy and PARC. As indicated by the combined evaluation metrics, Costal has high efficiency with small datasets and acceptable scalability for large datasets, which is beneficial for large-scale analysis.","[Arriaga, Edgar A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, 139 Smith Hall,Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Arriaga, EA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, 139 Smith Hall,Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",arriaga@umn.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [R01-AG020866]; National Science Foundation [IIS-2002321]; University of Minnesota [GIA University of Minnesota],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Minnesota [GIA University of Minnesota],"National Institutes of Health [R01-AG020866], the National Science Foundation [IIS-2002321], and the University of Minnesota [GIA University of Minnesota].

Thus, to improve clinical care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we explored the role of age-related p16 epimutation in intestinal tumorigenesis.MethodsWe established a mouse model that replicates two common genetic and epigenetic events observed in human CRCs: Apc mutation and p16 epimutation. We conducted long-term survival and histological analysis of tumor development and progression. Colonic epithelial cells and tumors were collected from mice and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating immune cells throughout tumor progression. We tested whether anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy affects overall survival of tumor-bearing mice and whether inhibition of both epigenetic regulation and immune checkpoint is more efficacious.ResultsMice carrying combined Apc mutation and p16 epimutation had significantly shortened survival and increased tumor growth compared to those with Apc mutation only. Intriguingly, colon tumors with p16 epimutation exhibited an activated interferon pathway, increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (Pdl1), and enhanced infiltration of immune cells. scRNA-seq further revealed the presence of Foxp3(+) Tregs and gamma delta T17 cells, which contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using an inhibitor of DNA methylation and a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor is more effective for improving survival in tumor-bearing mice than blockade of either pathway alone.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that age-dependent p16 epimutation creates a permissive microenvironment for malignant transformation of polyps to colon cancer. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for future targeted therapy in patients with p16 epimutation.","[Yang, Li; Chen, Xiaomin; Lawrence, Emily B.; Shen, Lanlan] USDA, Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Childrens Nutr Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77065 USA; [Lee, Christy; Li, Jingyi Jessica] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shi, Jiejun; Cui, Ya; Li, Wei] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Div Computat Biomed, Irvine, CA USA; [Shi, Jiejun] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Tongji Hosp, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Dept Gen Surg, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lanjing] Med Ctr Princeton, Dept Pathol, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Zhang, Lanjing] Rutgers State Univ, Earnest Mario Sch Pharm, Dept Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Li, Yumei; Creighton, Chad J.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Gao, Nan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ USA; [Jung, Sung Yun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Houston, TX USA; [Creighton, Chad J.; Arimura, Sumimasa] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX USA; [Creighton, Chad J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dan Duncan Comprehens Canc Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Arimura, Sumimasa] Baylor Coll Med, Sect Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Houston, TX USA; [Lei, Yunping] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Precis Environm Hlth, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Baylor College of Medicine; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Tongji University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Baylor College of Medicine; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine,"Shen, LL (corresponding author), USDA, Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Childrens Nutr Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77065 USA.",Lanlan.Shen@bcm.edu,"Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; Zhang, Yanyan/JFA-9161-2023; Chen, Xiaomin/AAJ-3021-2020; wang, wang/JQW-3034-2023; ARIMURA, SUMIMASA/IQT-4772-2023; Zhao, Yi/JFA-7988-2023; cheng, chen/JHS-9462-2023; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; Han, Yang/JVN-5921-2024; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; Zhang, Lanjing/D-1544-2009","ARIMURA, SUMIMASA/0000-0001-7676-4689; Shi, Jiejun/0000-0001-9777-1183; Shen, Lanlan/0000-0002-1532-5807; Zhang, Lanjing/0000-0001-5436-887X","US Department of Agriculture [CRIS 3092-51000-060]; National Institutes of Health [R21CA229727, R01HD100914, R01CA233472]",US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This research was supported by grants from US Department of Agriculture (CRIS 3092-51000-060 to L.S.) and National Institutes of Health (R21CA229727, R01HD100914, and R01CA233472 to L.S.).",,70,4,4,1,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1756-9966,,J EXP CLIN CANC RES,J.

Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm's capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks - and, thereby, DeFi protocols - would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.","[Kitzler, Stefan; Saggese, Pietro; Haslhofer, Bernhard] Complex Sci Hub, Josefstadter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Kitzler, Stefan] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Victor, Friedhelm] Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Saggese, Pietro] Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Technical University of Berlin; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Kitzler, S (corresponding author), Complex Sci Hub, Josefstadter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria.;Kitzler, S (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",kitzler@csh.ac.at; friedhelm.victor@fu-berlin.de; pietro.saggese@ait.ac.at; haslhofer@esh.ac.at,,"Victor, Friedhelm/0000-0001-8329-3133; Haslhofer, Bernhard/0000-0002-0415-4491; Saggese, Pietro/0000-0002-7387-0846; Kitzler, Stefan/0000-0001-8454-167X",,,,,54,4,4,1,6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1559-1131,1559-114X,,ACM T WEB,ACM Trans.

Thus, one family of community detection algorithms uses random walks to measure distance between nodes, and then applies clustering methods to these distances. Interestingly, information processing in the brain may suggest a simpler method of learning clusters directly from random walks. Drawing inspi-ration from the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in navigation, we propose a two-layer neural learning framework. Neurons in one layer are associated with graph nodes and are activated by random walks. These activations cause neurons in the second layer to become tuned to graph clusters through simple associative learning. The system can be modelled as Online Spherical K-Means clustering applied in a novel walk-space where all graph nodes are equidistant from each other. In tests on benchmark and real-world graphs, our framework achieved high normalized mutual information scores, executed faster than comparator algorithms, and showed high data efficiency by requiring as few as 6 random walks per graph node. Biological information processing systems are known for high efficiency and adaptability; here, drawing inspiration from the brain has provided a graph clustering method with these properties.","[Chalmers, Eric] Mt Royal Univ, Dept Math & Comp, 4825 Mt Royal Gate SW, Calgary, AB T3E 6K6, Canada; [Gruber, Aaron J.; Luczak, Artur] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",Mount Royal University; University of Lethbridge,"Chalmers, E (corresponding author), Mt Royal Univ, Dept Math & Comp, 4825 Mt Royal Gate SW, Calgary, AB T3E 6K6, Canada.;Luczak, A (corresponding author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",echalmers@mtroyal.ca; luczak@uleth.ca,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0020-0255,1872-6291,,INFORM SCIENCES,Inf.

The map equation, which is an information-theoretic framework based on the random walk on a network, is a particularly popular community detection method. Despite its outstanding performance in many applications, the inner workings of the map equation have not been thoroughly studied. Herein, we revisit the original formulation of the map equation and address the existence of its raw form, which we refer to as the single-trajectory map equation. This raw form sheds light on many details behind the principle of the map equation that are hidden in the steady-state limit of the random walk. Most importantly, the single-trajectory map equation provides a more balanced community structure, naturally reducing the tendency of the overfitting phenomenon in the map equation.","[Kawamoto, Tatsuro] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST),"Kawamoto, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan.",kawamoto.tatsuro@aist.go.jp,,,JST ACT-X [JPMJAX21A8]; JSPS KAKENHI [19H01506],"JST ACT-X; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author is grateful to Martin Rosvall for inspiring discussions.

To fill the gap between time series data analysis and complex network theory, the main objective is to capture spatio-temporal patterns of TBM dynamic excavation behavior from a topological structure perspective, which can provide valuable insights into geological information and over excavation ratio for intelligent tunneling project management. To accomplish this goal, the principal component analysis (PCA) is firstly utilized to reduce the dimension of the multivariate and heterogenous dataset for simplicity. Afterward, the time-lagged cross correlation (TLCC) and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) are implemented to measure the similarity between two segment rings for network graphing, resulting in a holistic view of the TBM excavation performance. Through the case study, network analysis results indicate that: (1) Leiden outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms in dividing the whole network into four high-quality communities. (2) There is a trend for segment rings with more similar excavation behavior and geological conditions to be gathered into the same community. (3) Since the over excavation ratio in four communities derived from the DTW-based complex network is proven to be significantly different, global sensitivity analysis is deployed to find out the most crucial features for decisionmaking in TBM control. The novelty to be highlighted is the developed time series analysis approach relying on the complex network perspective, which is helpful in effectively detecting relationships along with hidden engineering knowledge among rings. This has potential value in better understanding and improving the TBM tunneling performance under the underground environment with great complexity and uncertainty.","[Pan, Yue; Zhou, Xiaojing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infras, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Shuigen] Shanghai Mechanized Construct Grp, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; zlm@hust.edu.cn,"Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201171, 72271101]; Shanghai Sailing Program, China [22YF1419100]; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province [2022CFA062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program, China; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72201171 and 72271101) , the Shanghai Sailing Program, China (No: 22YF1419100) , and the Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province (No. 2022CFA062) .",,69,5,5,15,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

New datasets are significantly larger than a decade ago, and new experimental techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics continue to drive the need for clustering or classification techniques to focus on portions of datasets of interest. While many libraries and packages exist that implement various algorithms, there remains the need for clustering packages that are easy to use, integrated with visualization of the results, and integrated with other commonly used tools for biological data analysis. clusterMaker2 has added several new algorithms, including two entirely new categories of analyses: node ranking and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, many of the new algorithms have been implemented using the Cytoscape jobs API, which provides a mechanism for executing remote jobs from within Cytoscape. Together, these advances facilitate meaningful analyses of modern biological datasets despite their ever-increasing size and complexity.ResultsThe use of clusterMaker2 is exemplified by reanalyzing the yeast heat shock expression experiment that was included in our original paper; however, here we explored this dataset in significantly more detail. Combining this dataset with the yeast protein-protein interaction network from STRING, we were able to perform a variety of analyses and visualizations from within clusterMaker2, including Leiden clustering to break the entire network into smaller clusters, hierarchical clustering to look at the overall expression dataset, dimensionality reduction using UMAP to find correlations between our hierarchical visualization and the UMAP plot, fuzzy clustering, and cluster ranking. Using these techniques, we were able to explore the highest-ranking cluster and determine that it represents a strong contender for proteins working together in response to heat shock. We found a series of clusters that, when re-explored as fuzzy clusters, provide a better presentation of mitochondrial processes.ConclusionsclusterMaker2 represents a significant advance over the previously published version, and most importantly, provides an easy-to-use tool to perform clustering and to visualize clusters within the Cytoscape network context. The new algorithms should be welcome to the large population of Cytoscape users, particularly the new dimensionality reduction and fuzzy clustering techniques.","[Utriainen, Maija] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Morris, John H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Maastricht University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Morris, JH (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",scooter@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,,,,,75,5,5,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,APR 5,2023,24.0,1,,,,,,,134,10.1186/s12859-023-05225-z,0.0,,,28,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,C7ZM4,37020209.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000964054900002,0

In this survey, we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms.

The literature includes many approaches that are based on either image processing techniques or spectrums analysis. However, most of the available approaches have issues related to complexity and accuracy. This article suggests an unsupervised forgery detection framework that utilizes the correlations among the spectrums of documents' matters in generating a weighted network for the tested documents. The network, then, is clustered using several unsupervised clustering algorithms. The detection rate is measured according to the number of network clusters. Based on the obtained results, our approach provides high accuracy using the Louvain clustering algorithms, while the use of the updated version of the DBSAN was more successful when testing many documents at the same time.

To track the evolution of scientific communities and dig into the mechanism behind it, we formulate the task of event-based Group Evolution Pre-diction and apply interpretable machine learning approaches to the task. Seven evolution events for prediction are defined based on the evolution chains of scientific communities detected from the collaboration network. By using a detailed feature set, including topological, external, core node, and temporal attributes, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest are adopted for the prediction models. Experiments on the dataset of Library and Information Science shows that Random Forest performs the best, with the F1 scores of five events greater than 0.60.

However, most graph clustering algorithms just consider low-order topological connectivity, which limits their accuracy in gene module identification. In this study, we propose a novel network-based method, MultiSimNeNc, to identify modules in various types of networks by integrating network representation learning (NRL) and clustering algorithms. In this method, we first obtain the multi-order similarity of the network using graph convolution (GC). Then, we aggregate the multi-order similarity to characterize the network structure and use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to achieve low-dimensional node characterization. Finally, we predict the number of modules based on the bayesian information criterion (BIC) and use the gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify modules. To testify to the efficacy of MultiSimeNc in module identification, we apply this method to two types of biological networks and six benchmark networks, where the biological networks are constructed based on the fusion of multi-omics data from glioblastoma (GBM). The analysis shows that MultiSimNeNc outperforms several state-of-the-art module identification algorithms in identification accuracy, which is an effective method for understanding biomolecular mechanisms of pathogenesis from a module-level perspective.","[Wu, Hao; Liang, Biting; Zhang, Hongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhongli] Peoples Govt Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Shandong University,"Wu, H; Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",haowu@sdu.edu.cn; zhm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Wu, Hao/AGE-4639-2022; Zhang, Hongming/ABF-8690-2021","Wu, Hao/0000-0003-2340-9258; Zhang, Hongming/0000-0001-6133-693X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972322, 62272278]; Natural Key Research and Development Program, China [2021YFF0704103]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Key Research and Development Program, China; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","Funding The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61972322 & 62272278) , and by the Natural Key Research and Development Program, China (Grant No. 2021YFF0704103) , and by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China.

Having both expression profiles and tissue organization enables researchers to better understand cellular interactions and heterogeneity, providing insight into complex biological processes that would not be possible with traditional sequencing technologies. Data generated by ST technologies are inherently noisy, high-dimensional, sparse, and multi-modal (including histological images, count matrices, etc.), thus requiring specialized computational tools for accurate and robust analysis. However, many ST studies currently utilize traditional scRNAseq tools, which are inadequate for analyzing complex ST datasets. On the other hand, many of the existing ST-specific methods are built upon traditional statistical or machine learning frameworks, which have shown to be sub-optimal in many applications due to the scale, multi-modality, and limitations of spatially resolved data (such as spatial resolution, sensitivity, and gene coverage). Given these intricacies, researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based models to alleviate ST-specific challenges. These methods include new state-of-the-art models in alignment, spatial reconstruction, and spatial clustering, among others. However, DL models for ST analysis are nascent and remain largely underexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of existing state-of-the-art tools for analyzing spatially resolved transcriptomics while delving deeper into the DL-based approaches. We discuss the new frontiers and the open questions in this field and highlight domains in which we anticipate transformational DL applications.","[Heydari, A.

In this context, community detection is a pivotal issue in computational neuroscience. In this paper we explored community detection within brain connectomes using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the Leap's Hybrid Solver in D-Wave. By reframing the modularity optimization problem into a Discrete Quadratic Model, we show that quantum annealers achieved higher modularity indices compared to the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm without the need to overcomplicate the mathematical formulation. We also found that the number of communities detected in brain connectomes slightly differed while still being biologically interpretable.

This topic has attracted researchers from both academia and industry. Among different community detection methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) have become popular. Considering the drawbacks of the currently used locus-based and solution-vector-based encodings to represent the individuals, in this article, we propose (1) a new node similarity-based encoding method, MST-based encoding, to represent a network partition as an individual, which can avoid the shortcomings of the previous encoding schemes. Then, we propose (2) a new adaptive genetic algorithm for the purpose of detecting communities in networks, along with (3) a new initial population generation function to improve the convergence time of the algorithm, and (4) a new sine-based adaptive mutation function which adjusts the mutations according to the improvement in the fitness value of the best individual in the population pool. The proposed method combines the similarity-based and modularity-optimization-based approaches to find communities in complex networks in an evolutionary framework. Besides the fact that the proposed encoding can avoid meaningless mutations or disconnected communities, we show that the new initial population generation function and the new adaptive mutation function can improve the convergence time of the algorithm. Several experiments and comparisons were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using modularity and NMI measures on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results show that the proposed method can find the communities in a significantly shorter time than other GAs while reaching a better trade-off in the different measures.","[Hesamipour, Sajjad; Balafar, Mohammad Ali; Mousazadeh, Saeed] Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran",University of Tabriz,"Hesamipour, S (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",sajjadhesami@yahoo.com; balafarila@tabrizu.ac.ir; s.mousazadeh95@tabrizu.ac.ir,"Balafar, Prof M.A/D-1865-2010","Balafar, Prof M.A/0000-0001-5898-0871; Hesamipour, Sajjad/0000-0003-4886-8995",,,,,68,0,0,1,4,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,FEB 28,2023,2023.0,,,,,,,,4796536,10.1155/2023/4796536,0.0,,,22,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,9T7XE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000947235900001,0

Here, the authors develop scDML, a tool that simultaneously removes batch effects, improves clustering performance, recovers true cell types, and scales well to large datasets. scRNA-seq has uncovered previously unappreciated levels of heterogeneity. With the increasing scale of scRNA-seq studies, the major challenge is correcting batch effect and accurately detecting the number of cell types, which is inevitable in human studies. The majority of scRNA-seq algorithms have been specifically designed to remove batch effect firstly and then conduct clustering, which may miss some rare cell types. Here we develop scDML, a deep metric learning model to remove batch effect in scRNA-seq data, guided by the initial clusters and the nearest neighbor information intra and inter batches. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues demonstrated that scDML can remove batch effect, improve clustering performance, accurately recover true cell types and consistently outperform popular methods such as Seurat 3, scVI, Scanorama, BBKNN, Harmony et al. Most importantly, scDML preserves subtle cell types in raw data and enables discovery of new cell subtypes that are hard to extract by analyzing each batch individually. We also show that scDML is scalable to large datasets with lower peak memory usage, and we believe that scDML offers a valuable tool to study complex cellular heterogeneity.","[Yu, Xiaokang; Zhang, Jingxiao] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Appl Stat, Sch Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xinyi] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Math, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangjie] Changping Lab, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance & Economics; Changping Laboratory,"Zhang, JX (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Ctr Appl Stat, Sch Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Li, XJ (corresponding author), Changping Lab, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",zhjxiao@ruc.edu.cn; xiangjieli@cpl.ac.cn,"zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; Wang, yl/JNR-4963-2023; LI, Yueyi/JUF-7422-2023; Lu, Wang/JVO-0416-2024; chen, si/JPK-4258-2023; Huang, Jingyi/KCY-2239-2024; Ma, Xiaodong/JAN-7473-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023","Xu, Xinyi/0000-0001-5081-625X; Li, Xiangjie/0000-0002-9600-8984",Changping Laboratory; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Public Health & Disease Control and Prevention; Fund for Building World-Class Universities (Disciplines) of Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance and Economics,Changping Laboratory; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Public Health & Disease Control and Prevention; Fund for Building World-Class Universities (Disciplines) of Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance and Economics,"This work was supported by Changping Laboratory and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (to X.L.), Public Health & Disease Control and Prevention, Fund for Building World-Class Universities (Disciplines) of Renmin University of China (to J.Z.) and the disciplinary funding of Central University of Finance and Economics (to X.X.).",,58,9,10,7,25,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2041-1723,,NAT COMMUN,Nat.

In recent years, many trajectory inference methods have been developed. They have focused on using the graph method to infer the trajectory using single-cell data, and then calculate the geodesic distance as the pseudotime. However, these methods are vulnerable to errors caused by the inferred trajectory. Therefore, the calculated pseudotime suffers from such errors. Results: We proposed a novel framework for trajectory inference called the single-cell data Trajectory inference method using Ensemble Pseudotime inference (scTEP). scTEP utilizes multiple clustering results to infer robust pseudotime and then uses the pseudotime to fine-tune the learned trajectory. We evaluated the scTEP using 41 real scRNA-seq data sets, all of which had the ground truth development trajectory. We compared the scTEP with state-of-the-art methods using the aforementioned data sets. Experiments on real linear and non-linear data sets demonstrate that our scTEP performed superior on more data sets than any other method. The scTEP also achieved a higher average and lower variance on most metrics than other state-of-the-art methods. In terms of trajectory inference capacity, the scTEP outperforms those methods. In addition, the scTEP is more robust to the unavoidable errors resulting from clustering and dimension reduction. Conclusion: The scTEP demonstrates that utilizing multiple clustering results for the pseudotime inference procedure enhances its robustness. Furthermore, robust pseudotime strengthens the accuracy of trajectory inference, which is the most crucial component in the pipeline.","[Zhang, Yifan; Tran, Duc; Nguyen, Tin; Dascalu, Sergiu M.; Harris, Frederick C.] Univ Nevada, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",yfzhang@nevada.unr.edu,"Tran, Duc/W-6094-2019; Shen, Yan/KEJ-4617-2024; bai, yu/KHU-2608-2024; Nguyen, Tin/F-4420-2018; Harris, Frederick C/HTQ-8421-2023; liu, miao/KGL-7043-2024","Tran, Duc/0000-0003-2918-8601; Harris, Frederick C/0000-0002-0857-6931;",National Science Foundation [OIA-2019609],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number OIA-2019609 Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.",,44,3,4,3,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,FEB 20,2023,24.0,1,,,,,,,55,10.1186/s12859-023-05179-2,0.0,,,21,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,9E7CU,36803767.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000936940000002,0

Therefore, different regions of the lobule exhibit differences in their contribution to hepatocyte turnover, and zone 2 is an important source of new hepatocytes during homeostasis and regeneration.","[Wei, Yonglong; Wang, Yunguan G.; Jia, Yuemeng; Li, Lin; Yoon, Jung; Zhang, Shuyuan; Zhang, Yu; Sharma, Tripti; Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Hsieh, Meng-Hsiung; Zhu, Hao] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dept Pediat, Ctr Regenerat Sci & Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wei, Yonglong; Wang, Yunguan G.; Jia, Yuemeng; Li, Lin; Yoon, Jung; Zhang, Shuyuan; Zhang, Yu; Sharma, Tripti; Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Hsieh, Meng-Hsiung; Zhu, Hao] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Regenerat Sci & Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wang, Yunguan G.; Wang, Tao] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Quantitat Biomed Res Ctr, Dept Populat & Data Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wang, Zixi; Zhu, Min; Zhu, Hao] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst Mouse Genome Engn Core, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Albrecht, Jeffrey H.] Minneapolis VA Hlth Care Syst, Gastroenterol Div, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA; [Albrecht, Jeffrey H.] Univ Minnesota, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Le, Phuong T.; Rosen, Clifford J.] Maine Med Ctr, Res Inst, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Maine Medical Center,"Zhu, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dept Pediat, Ctr Regenerat Sci & Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.;Zhu, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Regenerat Sci & Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.;Zhu, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst Mouse Genome Engn Core, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",hao.zhu@utsouthwestern.edu,"Le, Phuong/B-3959-2019; Wang, Yunguan/L-1153-2019; Jia, Yuemeng/JAC-4097-2023; Wang, Zixi/KEI-0077-2024; Hsieh, Meng-hsiung/HJH-9821-2023; ROsen, Dr. Clifford/JOZ-3228-2023; Sharma, Tripti/AAI-6278-2021; Wang, Zixi/JMP-7296-2023; Jia, Yuemeng/AAQ-9853-2021; Zhang, shuyuan/IUN-4098-2023; Zhu, Hao/L-5114-2013","Hsieh, Meng-hsiung/0000-0001-9791-1318; Sharma, Tripti/0000-0003-1799-1157; Wei, Yonglong/0000-0001-6152-7963; Wang, Yunguan/0000-0003-0767-6188; Wang, Zixi/0000-0002-9354-1206; Zhu, Hao/0000-0002-8417-9698; ZHANG, SHUYUAN/0000-0002-6220-5998; Jia, Yuemeng/0000-0002-8019-1534","NIH/NIDDK [R01DK54921, R01DK111588]; NIH [R03ES026397]; CPRIT [RP150596, RP190208, RP170267, RP180268]; Pollack Foundation; NIH/NCI [R01CA251928]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award for Medical Scientists; Stand Up To Cancer Innovative Research Grant [SU2C-AACR-IRG 10-16]; American Association for Cancer Research, the scientific partner of SU2C","NIH/NIDDK(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); CPRIT(Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas); Pollack Foundation; NIH/NCI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Burroughs Wellcome Career Award for Medical Scientists(Burroughs Wellcome Fund); Stand Up To Cancer Innovative Research Grant; American Association for Cancer Research, the scientific partner of SU2C","J.H.A. was supported by NIH/NIDDK R01DK54921.

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travellers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g. around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data are available.","[Goesgens, Martijn; Hendriks, Teun; Boon, Marko; van der Hofstad, Remco; Litvak, Nelly] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Steenbakkers, Wim] Mezuro, Weesp, Netherlands; [Heesterbeek, Hans] Univ Utrecht, Populat Hlth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Litvak, Nelly] Univ Twente, Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci, Enschede, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Utrecht University; University of Twente,"G√∂sgens, M (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",research@martijngosgens.nl,"van der Harst, Pim/HOH-5622-2023","van der Harst, Pim/0000-0002-2713-686X; Boon, Marko/0000-0001-8804-8743; Gosgens, Martijn/0000-0002-7197-7682; Litvak, Nelly/0000-0002-6750-3484; van der Hofstad, Remco/0000-0003-1331-9697; Heesterbeek, Hans/0000-0001-8537-6418","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS [024.002.003]; NWO through ZonMw grant [10430022010001, 10430 03201 0011]",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NWO through ZonMw grant,"The work of M.G. and R.v.d.H. is supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS grant no. 024.002.003.

Two examples of important web technologies used in health are news media and patient forums. Both have a significant role in shaping patients' perspective and behaviour in relation to health and illness, as well as the way that they might choose or change their treatment. In this paper, the authors investigated the application of web technologies using the data analysis approach. The authors did this analysis from the point of view of topics being discussed and disseminated via patients and journalists in breast and lung cancer. The study also investigated the (dis)alignment amongst these two groups and scientists in terms of topics. Design/methodology/approach - Three data sets comprised documents published between 2014 and 2018 obtained from ProQuest and Web of Science Medline databases, alongside data from three major patient forums on breast and lung cancer. The analysis and visualisation in this paper have been done using the udpipe, igraph R packages and VOSviewer. Findings - The study's findings showed that in general scientists focussed more on prognosis and treatment of cancer, whereas patients and journalists focussed more on detection, prevention and role of social and emotional support. The only exception was for news coverage of lung cancer where the largest cluster was related to treatment, research in cancer treatment and therapies. However, when comparing coverage by scientists and journalists in terms of treatment, the focus of news articles in both cancer types was mainly on chemotherapy and complimentary therapies. Finally, topics such as lifestyle or pain management were only discussed by breast cancer patients. Originality/value - The results obtained from this study may provide valuable insights into topics of interest for each group of scientists, journalist and patients as well as (dis)alignment among them in terms of topics. These findings are important as scientific research is heavily dependent on communication, and research does not exist in a bubble. Scientists and journalists can gain insights from patients' experiences and needs, which in turn may help them to have a more holistic and realistic view.

We propose a community detection algorithm based on a density peak clustering model and multiple attribute decision-making strategy, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution). First, the two-dimensional dataset, which is transformed from the network by taking the density and distance as the attributes of nodes, is clustered by using the DBSCAN algorithm, and outliers are determined and taken as the key nodes. Then, the initial community frameworks are formed and expanded by adding the most similar node of the community as its new member. In this process, we use TOPSIS to cohesively integrate four kinds of similarities to calculate an index, and use it as a criterion to select the most similar node. Then, we allocate the nonkey nodes that are not covered in the expanded communities. Finally, some communities are merged to obtain a stable partition in two ways. This paper designs some experiments for the algorithm on some real networks and some synthetic networks, and the proposed method is compared with some popular algorithms. The experimental results testify for the effectiveness and show the accuracy of our algorithm.","[Cheng, Jianjun; Wang, Xu; Gong, Wenshuang; Li, Jun; Chen, Nuo; Chen, Xiaoyun] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Cheng, JJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",chengjianjun@lzu.edu.cn,"Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024; jing, wang/KCZ-2144-2024","Cheng, Jianjun/0000-0002-0044-0861",Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China [20JR5RA284],Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China,This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China (Grant no. 20JR5RA284).,,59,1,1,0,5,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,DEC 7,2021,2021,,,,,,,,1772407,10.1155/2021/1772407,0.0,,,18,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,ZT4RV,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000769146000002,0

Roughly speaking, the WBFM first converts the attributes into an attributive network so that one obtains the two networks-structural and attributive-instead of the ASN. Then, the two networks are fused into a composite one that is believed to contain the information about both the structure and the attributes and that can be already fed to traditional modularity-driven graph CD approaches. While the WBFM is widely used, it has been understudied analytically and had only a heuristic ground. In this paper, we disclose the mathematical machinery of the WBFM by revealing the objective function of the corresponding optimization CD process and establishing its connection with the traditional ASN CD quality measures. We also propose a pioneering non-manual parameter tuning scheme that provides the desired impact of the structure and the attributes on the CD results within the WBFM. Based on our theoretical results, we further present a well-tunable Leiden-based ASN CD algorithm that declares itself fast and accurate in our multiple experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets.","[Chunaev, Petr; Gradov, Timofey; Bochenina, Klavdiya] ITMO Univ, Natl Ctr Cognit Technol, St Petersburg, Russia",ITMO University,"Chunaev, P (corresponding author), ITMO Univ, Natl Ctr Cognit Technol, St Petersburg, Russia.",chunaev@itmo.ru; timagradov@yahoo.com; kbochenina@itmo.ru,"Chunaev, Petr/W-7760-2018","Chunaev, Petr/0000-0001-8169-8436",Russian Science Foundation [17-71-30029],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"This research was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation, Agreement 17-71-30029, with co-financing of Bank Saint Petersburg.",,49,1,2,0,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",1869-5450,1869-5469,,SOC NETW ANAL MIN,Soc.

The definition of the properties of single cells is the primary endpoint of such analysis, cells are typically clustered to underpin the common determinants that can be used to describe functional properties of the cell mixture under investigation. Several approaches have been proposed to identify cell clusters; while this is matter of active research, one popular approach is based on community detection in neighbourhood graphs by optimisation of modularity. In this paper we propose an alternative and principled solution to this problem, based on Stochastic Block Models. We show that such approach not only is suitable for identification of cell groups, it also provides a solid framework to perform other relevant tasks in single cell analysis, such as label transfer. To encourage the use of Stochastic Block Models, we developed a python library, schist, that is compatible with the popular scanpy framework.","[Morelli, Leonardo; Giansanti, Valentina; Cittaro, Davide] IRCCS San Raffaele Inst, Ctr Omics Sci, Milan, Italy; [Morelli, Leonardo] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; [Giansanti, Valentina] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Informat Syst & Commun, Milan, Italy",Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Cittaro, D (corresponding author), IRCCS San Raffaele Inst, Ctr Omics Sci, Milan, Italy.",cittaro.davide@hsr.it,"Cittaro, Davide/K-2405-2018; Giansanti, Valentina/AAC-3638-2022","Cittaro, Davide/0000-0003-0384-3700; Giansanti, Valentina/0000-0003-0617-6245; Morelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-2477-5172",Cancer Research UK [A26815]; Fondazione AIRC,Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Fondazione AIRC(Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro),This work has been supported by Accelerator Award: A26815 entitled: Single-cell cancer evolution in the clinicfunded through a partnership between Cancer Research UK and Fondazione AIRC.,,61,6,6,1,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,NOV 30,2021,22,1,,,,,,,576,10.1186/s12859-021-04489-7,0.0,,,19,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,XF4CI,34847879.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000724019800002,0

Current hierarchical community-discovery algorithms generally consider a single node as a community during the initial stage. This approach leads to over-fine clustering granularity, too-deep clustering levels, and other issues. Therefore, this article proposes a hierarchical community-discovery algorithm that combines the core nodes and the three-order structure model. Between neighboring nodes, there is a first-order structure. The core node is identified based on its influence, and the similarity between the core node and its neighboring nodes is defined as the second-order structure. The nodes satisfying the second-order structure are then formed into a friend circle. The similarity between friend circles is defined as the third-order structure. According to this structure, the friend circles are construed as a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) where one HCT represents a community. The HCT built by this algorithm has relatively fewer levels and exhibits a flat feature. Experimental results on both artificial and real networks show that the algorithm performs well on various indicators. Additionally, the algorithm exhibits near-linear time complexity.","[Guo Lei; Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Li Shaozi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Educ Dept Fujian Prov, Key Lab Cognit Comp & Intelligent Informat Proc F, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Guo Lei; Wu Qingshou] Digital Fujian Tourism Big Data Inst, Fujian Dev & Reform Commiss, Wuyishan, Fujian, Peoples R China","Wuyi University, Fujian; Xiamen University","Wu, QS (corresponding author), Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China.",wyswuqsh@163.com,"Li, SZ/G-3959-2010","guo, lei/0000-0001-7269-971X","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University [2019LSAF03]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2019J01835]; Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions [KLCCIIP2018107]","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions","TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University, Grant/Award Number: 2019LSAF03; The Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019J01835; TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions, Grant/Award Number: KLCCIIP2018107",,57,0,0,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

Applying a community detection algorithm results in a division of a network into communities that is often used to inspect and reason about community membership of specific nodes. This micro-level interpretation step of community structure is a crucial step in typical social science research. However, the methodological caveat in this step is that virtually all modern community detection methods are non-deterministic and based on randomization and approximated results. This needs to be explicitly taken into consideration when reasoning about community membership of individual nodes. To do so, we propose a metric of community membership consistency, that provides node-level insights in how reliable the placement of that node into a community really is. In addition, it enables us to distinguish the community core members of a community. The usefulness of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on corporate board interlock networks, in which weighted links represent shared senior level directors between firms. Results suggest that the community structure of global business groups is centered around persistent communities consisting of core countries tied by geographical and cultural proximity. In addition, we identify fringe countries that appear to associate with a number of different global business communities.","[van Kuppevelt, Dafne E.; Bakhshi, Rena] Netherlands eSci Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Heemskerk, Eelke M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Takes, Frank W.] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"van Kuppevelt, DE (corresponding author), Netherlands eSci Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Takes, FW (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands.",d.vankuppevelt@esciencecenter.nl; takes@uva.nl,"; Takes, Frank/G-8038-2016","Heemskerk, Eelke/0000-0001-7356-5318; Takes, Frank/0000-0001-5468-1030; Bakhshi, Rena/0000-0002-2932-3028",Netherlands eScience Center,Netherlands eScience Center,This research was partly funded by the Netherlands eScience Center.,,37,0,0,2,8,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2432-2717,2432-2725,,J COMPUT SOC SCI,J.

Based on the analysis of the Louvain algorithm, considering the local topology of the node in the network and the communication range of the node, a new algorithm LSCR for core node identification was constructed. The LSCR algorithm and Louvain algorithm were merged to obtain a new and improved algorithm, Louvain-LSCR. In this algorithm, the leaf nodes in phase 1 of Louvain algorithm were first pruned to reduce calculations; then, seed nodes were selected according to the LSCR algorithm in phase 2. The experimental results on related datasets show that LSCR algorithm has certain advantages in identifying core nodes. The modularity of Louvian-LSCR algorithm is better than other algorithms, and the community structure is more reasonable.

However, the problem of discovery and description of hidden communities, including defining the proper level of user aggregation, remains an important problem not yet resolved. Studies of online communities have clear social implications, as they allow for assessment of preference-based user grouping and the detection of socially hazardous groups. The aim of this study is to comparatively assess the algorithms that effectively analyze large user networks and extract hidden user communities from them. The results we have obtained show the most suitable algorithms for Twitter datasets of different volumes (dozen thousands, hundred thousands, and millions of tweets). We show that the Infomap and Leiden algorithms provide for the best results overall, and we advise testing a combination of these algorithms for detecting discursive communities based on user traits or views. We also show that the generalized K-means algorithm does not apply to big datasets, while a range of other algorithms tend to prioritize the detection of just one big community instead of many that would mirror the reality better. For isolating overlapping communities, the GANXiS algorithm should be used, while OSLOM is not advised.","[Blekanov, Ivan; Akhmetov, Askar] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Appl Math & Control Proc, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Bodrunova, Svetlana S.] St Petersburg State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, St Petersburg 199004, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Blekanov, I (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Appl Math & Control Proc, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.",s.bodrunova@spbu.ru,"Bodrunova, Svetlana/H-7051-2013; Blekanov, Ivan/G-8844-2015","Bodrunova, Svetlana/0000-0003-0740-561X; Blekanov, Ivan/0000-0002-7305-1429",Center for International Media Research of St. Petersburg State University [75290079],Center for International Media Research of St. Petersburg State University,FundingThis research was funded by the Center for International Media Research of St. Petersburg State University (project #75290079).,,37,4,4,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-5903,,FUTURE INTERNET,Future Internet,NOV,2021,13,11,,,,,,,295,10.3390/fi13110295,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,XJ6XB,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000726927000001,0

This new problem focuses on the dynamic process of the clustering rather than on the final picture of the clustering process. To address it, we introduce a new hierarchical clustering algorithm in networks, based on a new shortest path betweenness measure. To calculate it, the communication between each pair of nodes is weighed by the importance of the nodes that establish this communication. The weights or importance associated to each pair of nodes are calculated as the Shapley value of a game, named as the linear modularity game. This new measure, (the node-game shortest path betweenness measure), is used to obtain a hierarchical partition of the network by eliminating the link with the highest value. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we introduce several criteria that allow us to compare different dendrograms of a network from two point of view: modularity and homogeneity. Finally, we propose a faster algorithm based on a simplification of the node-game shortest path betweenness measure, whose order is quadratic on sparse networks. This fast version is competitive from a computational point of view with other hierarchical fast algorithms, and, in general, it provides better results.","[Gomez, Daniel; Castro, Javier; Gutierrez, Inmaculada; Espinola, Rosa] Complutense Univ Puerta de Hierro, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Gomez, Daniel; Castro, Javier; Espinola, Rosa] Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Evaluac Sanitaria, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Guti√©rrez, I (corresponding author), Complutense Univ Puerta de Hierro, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain.",dagomez@estad.ucm.es; jcastroc@estad.ucm.es; inmaguti@ucm.es; rosaev@estad.ucm.es,"Esp√≠nola, Rosa/I-2908-2015; Gomez, Daniel/G-1586-2010; Castro, Javier/H-7220-2015","Gomez, Daniel/0000-0001-9548-5781; Castro, Javier/0000-0002-5345-8870; GUTIERREZ, INMACULADA/0000-0002-7103-393X","Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i [PID2020-116884GB-I00, PGC2018096509-B-I00]; Complutense University of Madrid [PR108/20-28, CT17/17-CT18/17]","Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i; Complutense University of Madrid","This research was funded by the Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i [PID2020-116884GB-I00 and PGC2018096509-B-I00] and the Complutense University of Madrid [PR108/20-28 and CT17/17-CT18/17.",,47,4,4,1,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,NOV,2021,9,21,,,,,,,2666,10.3390/math9212666,0.0,,,29,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,WY1XN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000719077900001,0

As large trophic networks cannot be simulated in their original size - it would be too computationally expansive - they are shrunk by aggregating species together. However, key species may get lumped during this process, masking their unique role in their ecosystem. Therefore, a more systematic understanding of the aggregation effects on key positions is needed. Here, we study how six aggregation methods change 24 importance indices used to find key species in food webs.

The aggregation methods we considered were: 1) hierarchical clustering with the Jaccard index; 2) hierarchical clustering with the REGE index; 3) clustering within classic food web modules, which we refer to as 'density-based' modules; 4) clustering within 'predator-based modules' in which species fed on the same preys; 5) clustering within 'prey-based modules' in which species are fed upon by the same predators; and 6) clustering within 'groups' in which species share the same probability to interact with other groups. Hierarchical clustering with the REGE index produced the best results. Therefore, we recommend using it if we were interested in maintaining the identity of key species. The other algorithms could also be used to study specific network processes. However, we need to consider the bias they produce when masking important species.","[Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Ctr Ecol Res, Budapest, Hungary; [Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Jordan, Ferenc] Cent European Univ, Democracy Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Jordan, Ferenc] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Ecological Research; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Central European University; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli,"Jord√°n, F (corresponding author), Cent European Univ, Democracy Inst, Budapest, Hungary.;Jord√°n, F (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy.",,"Giacomuzzo, Emanuele/GVS-0262-2022; Jordan, Ferenc/A-9940-2009","Jordan, Ferenc/0000-0002-0224-6472; Giacomuzzo, Emanuele/0000-0003-2119-2163; Haugum, Siri Vatso/0000-0003-4958-7132",[SEP-210591007],,"FJ was supported by AtlantECO (H2020 BG-08-2018-2019, grant no.

However, the molecular, cellular and anatomic heterogeneity underlying its functional diversity remains incompletely understood. In this study, we generated a cell census of the mouse NAc using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization, revealing a high level of cell heterogeneity in this brain region. Here we show that the transcriptional and spatial diversity of neuron subtypes underlie the NAc's anatomic and functional heterogeneity. These findings explain how the seemingly simple neuronal composition of the NAc achieves its highly heterogenous structure and diverse functions. Collectively, our study generates a spatially resolved cell taxonomy for understanding the structure and function of the NAc, which demonstrates the importance of combining molecular and spatial information in revealing the fundamental features of the nervous system. The authors generated a cell census of mouse nucleus accumbens using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed error-robust FISH.

As demonstrated by applications from numerous industry groups and interest from regulatory authorities, QSP is becoming an increasingly critical component in clinical drug development. With rapidly evolving computational tools and methods, QSP modeling has achieved important progress in pharmaceutical research and development, including for heart failure (HF). However, various challenges exist in the QSP modeling and clinical characterization of HF. Machine/deep learning (ML/DL) methods have had success in a wide variety of fields and disciplines. They provide data-driven approaches in HF diagnosis and modeling, and offer a novel strategy to inform QSP model development and calibration. The combination of ML/DL and QSP modeling becomes an emergent direction in the understanding of HF and clinical development new therapies. In this work, we review the current status and achievement in QSP and ML/DL for HF, and discuss remaining challenges and future perspectives in the field.","[Cheng, Limei; Schmidt, Brian J.] Bristol Myers Squibb, Quantitat Syst Pharmacol & Physiol Based Pharmaco, Plainsboro, NJ 08536 USA; [Qiu, Yuchi; Wei, Guo-Wei] Michigan State Univ, Dept Math, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wei, Guo-Wei] Michigan State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wei, Guo-Wei] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Cheng, LM (corresponding author), Bristol Myers Squibb, Quantitat Syst Pharmacol & Physiol Based Pharmaco, Plainsboro, NJ 08536 USA.",limei.cheng@bms.com,"Cheng, Limei/AEN-1571-2022; Schmidt, Brian J/A-3805-2009; Qiu, Yuchi/ADE-6661-2022; Qiu, Yuchi/KLC-4104-2024; Qiu, Yuchi/ACC-3466-2022","Qiu, Yuchi/0000-0002-7058-6428; Qiu, Yuchi/0000-0002-7058-6428; , Limei/0000-0001-5357-6757; Schmidt, Brian/0000-0001-6015-9636","NIH [GM126189]; NSF [DMS-2052983, DMS-1761320, IIS-1900473]; NASA [80NSSC21M0023]; Michigan State Foundation; Bristol-Myers Squibb [65109]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01GM126189] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Michigan State Foundation; Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This work was supported in part by NIH grant GM126189, NSF grants DMS-2052983, DMS-1761320, and IIS-1900473, NASA grant 80NSSC21M0023, Michigan State Foundation, Bristol-Myers Squibb 65109.",,113,8,8,1,15,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1567-567X,1573-8744,,J PHARMACOKINET PHAR,J.

Social media users are clustered based on the topics related to the research publications they share in social media. This allows removing linkages which respond to social or personal proximity and identifying disconnected users who may have similar research interests. We test this method for users tweeting publications from the fields of Information Science & Library Science, and Microbiology.

A key question in the initial analysis of such spatial transcriptomics data is the assignment of cell types. To date, most studies used methods that only rely on the expression levels of the genes in each cell for such assignments. To fully utilize the data and to improve the ability to identify novel sub-types, we developed a new method, FICT, which combines both expression and neighborhood information when assigning cell types. Results: FICT optimizes a probabilistic function that we formalize and for which we provide learning and inference algorithms. We used FICT to analyze both simulated and several real spatial transcriptomics data.

With the proliferation of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of cell-type organization. Here we generated transcriptomes and epigenomes from morethan 500,000 individual cells in the mouse primary motor cortex, a structure that has an evolutionarily conserved role in locomotion. We developed computational and statistical methods to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type reproducibility. The resulting reference atlascontaining over 56 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies and modalities-is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account ofthe diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in layer4 in other cortical regions(4). We further discovered thousands of concordant marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types. Our results highlight the complex molecular regulation of cell types in the brain and will directly enable the design of reagentsto target specific cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex for functional analysis.","[Yao, Zizhen; Bertagnolli, Darren; Casper, Tamara; Crichton, Kirsten; Dee, Nick; Fong, Olivia; Goldy, Jeff; Hawrylycz, Mike; Kroll, Matthew; Lathia, Kanan; McMillen, Delissa; Nguyen, Thuc Nghi; Pham, Thanh; Rimorin, Christine; Smith, Kimberly; Sulc, Josef; Tieu, Michael; Torkelson, Amy; Tung, Herman; van Velthoven, Cindy; Tasic, Bosiljka; Zeng, Hongkui] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Liu, Hanqing; Aldridge, Andrew, I; Bartlett, Anna; Luo, Chongyuan; Nery, Joseph R.; Niu, Sheng-Yong; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA USA; [Xie, Fangming] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fischer, Stephan; Crow, Megan; Gillis, Jesse] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Stanley Inst Cognit Genom, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Adkins, Ricky S.; Ament, Seth A.; Colantuoni, Carlo; Crabtree, Jonathan; Creasy, Heather; Felix, Victor; Giglio, Michelle; Herb, Brian R.; Hertzano, Ronna; Mahurkar, Anup; Orvis, Joshua; White, Owen R.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Inst Genome Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Behrens, M.

Single-cell RNA sequencing allows systematic identification of cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain(1,2). Single-cell epigenomic profiling(3,4) further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation. Here we used a single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)(5), to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex. We profiled approximately 300,000 cells in the mouse primary motor cortex and its adjacent areas, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted laminar organizations. Intratelencephalic neurons formed a largely continuous gradient along the cortical depth axis, in which the gene expression of individual cells correlated with their cortical depths. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde labelling to probe projection targets of neurons of the mouse primary motor cortex and found that their cortical projections formed a complex network in which individual neuronal clusters project to multiple target regions and individual target regions receive inputs from multiple neuronal clusters.","[Zhang, Meng; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhang, Meng; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhang, Meng; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zingg, Brian; Cotter, Kaelan; Dong, Hongwei] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Integrat Connect, Mark & Mary Stevens Neuroimaging & Informat Inst, Keck Sch Med,USC, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Yao, Zizhen; Zeng, Hongkui] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Zingg, Brian; Cotter, Kaelan; Dong, Hongwei] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, UCLA Brain Res & Artificial Intelligence Nexus, Dept Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; University of Southern California; University of Southern California Keck Hospital; Allen Institute for Brain Science; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA,"Zhuang, XW (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Zhuang, XW (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Zhuang, XW (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",zhuang@chemistry.harvard.edu,,"Cotter, Kaelan/0000-0002-8067-9062; Zeng, Hongkui/0000-0002-0326-5878; Yao, Zizhen/0000-0002-9361-5607","US National Institutes of Health [U19MH114830, U19MH114821]; National Institute of Mental Health [U19MH114830, U19MH114821] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"This work was supported in part by the US National Institutes of Health (U19MH114830 to H.Z. and X.Z., and U19MH114821 to H.D. and X.Z.).

Inter-individual variation in modular structure has been linked to differences in performance, disease, and development. There exist many data-driven methods for detecting and comparing modular structure, the most popular of which is modularity maximization. Although modularity maximization is a general framework that can be modified and reparamaterized to address domain-specific research questions, its application to neuroscientific datasets has, thus far, been narrow. Here, we highlight several strategies in which the out-of-the-box version of modularity maximization can be extended to address questions specific to neuroscience. First, we present approaches for detecting space-independent modules and for applying modularity maximization to signed matrices. Next, we show that the modularity maximization frame is well-suited for detecting task- and condition-specific modules. Finally, we highlight the role of mull-layer models in detecting and tracking modules across time, tasks, subjects, and modalities. In summary, modularity maximization is a flexible and general framework that can be adapted to detect modular structure resulting from a wide range of hypotheses. This article highlights multiple frontiers for future research and applications.","[Esfahlani, Farnaz Zamani; Jo, Youngheun; Puxeddu, Maria Grazia; Greenwell, Sarah; Patel, Riya; Faskowitz, Joshua; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Faskowitz, Joshua] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Sapienza University Rome; IRCCS Santa Lucia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rbetzel@indiana.edu,"Betzel, Richard/AFL-9399-2022; Jo, Youngheun/JUV-2426-2023; Faskowitz, Josh/K-1330-2019","Betzel, Richard/0000-0001-9200-1681; Jo, Youngheun/0000-0003-1428-6348; Faskowitz, Josh/0000-0003-1814-7206",,,,,131,16,16,2,32,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,DEC 1,2021,244,,,,,,,,118607,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118607,0.0,,OCT 2021,15,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",WK8LO,34607022.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000709972900016,0

The AQCM algorithm performs hierarchical clustering in any data set for which there is an associated similarity measure quantifying the similarity of any data i and data j. Importantly, the method exhibits two valuable performance properties: (1) the ability to automatically return either a larger or smaller number of clusters depending on the inherent properties of the data rather than on a parameter. (2) the ability to return a very large number of relatively small clusters automatically when such clusters are reasonably well defined in a data set. In this work we present the general idea of a quasiclique agglomerative approach, provide the full details of the mathematical steps of the AQCM algorithm, and explain some of the motivation behind the new methodology. The main achievement of the new methodology is that the agglomerative process now unfolds adaptively according to the inherent structure unique to a given data set, and this happens without the time-costly parameter adjustment that drove the previous QCM algorithm. For this reason we call the new algorithm automatic. We provide a demonstration of the algorithm's performance at the task of community detection in a social media network of 22,900 nodes.

While many single-cell transcriptome-specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise, it is difficult to ascertain which method functions best. Results: We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP, single-cell Pick Optimal Parameters) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and cell type/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile-based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and 3 species to create a massive ocular single-cell transcriptome meta-atlas. Conclusions: This provides a model for how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.","[Swamy, Vinay S.; McGaughey, David M.] NEI, Bioinformat Grp, Ophthalm Genet & Visual Funct Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fufa, Temesgen D.; Hufnagel, Robert B.] NEI, Med Genet & Ophthalm Genom Unit, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI),"McGaughey, DM (corresponding author), 10 Ctr Dr,Room 10B16, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mcgaugheyd@mail.nih.gov,,"Fufa, Temesgen/0000-0002-8298-0051; McGaughey, David/0000-0002-9224-2888","Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health [EY000469]","Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health (grant No. EY000469), awarded to Brian Brooks.",,68,12,14,4,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2047-217X,,,GIGASCIENCE,GigaScience,OCT,2021,10,10,,,,,,,giab061,10.1093/gigascience/giab061,0.0,,,12,Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,2A8VC,34651173.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000809772400001,0

Therefore, contractors urgently need to accurately understand the competitive environment in which they will operate. In construction, few empirical studies exist on competitive environments from the standpoint of enterprise-to-enterprise competitive interactions. Based on market commonality, several hypotheses concerning the competitive pattern of the construction market have been proposed. To test these, a model of competing relationship networks is created using 7402 bid-winner notices for construction projects in Chongqing, China, from 2015 to 2018, followed by quantitative analysis and discussion of the model's characteristic features. The findings suggest that there is a community-type  rivalry in the building market, which represents the essential characteristics of market commonality. The research shows that the competitive action of construction enterprises is affected by construction technology, industrial division of labor and regional markets, and the competitive relationship between them tends to be strong-strong . This study reveals that the community  competitive relationship in the construction industry may be a unique phenomenon, expands the application and development of market commonality and enterprise clusters in the construction economy, and provides theoretical guidance for construction enterprises to accurately recognize competitive behavior and decision making.","[Chen, Keda; Ye, Kunhui] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Ye, KH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",chenkeda@cqu.edu.cn; Kunhui_YE@cqu.edu.cn,,"Ye, Kunhui/0000-0003-3734-3448; keda, chen/0000-0002-4066-1351",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871033],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"FundingThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71871033.",,64,0,0,2,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,OCT,2021,11,10,,,,,,,435,10.3390/buildings11100435,0.0,,,14,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,WP3FC,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000713020900001,0

Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and comparing variations in spatial arrangements within network geometries are of interest when explicit fracture representations or discrete fracture network models are chosen to capture the influence of fractures on bulk rock behaviour. Treating fracture networks as spatial graphs, we introduce a novel approach to quantify spatial variation. The method combines graph similarity measures with hierarchical clustering and is applied to investigate the spatial variation within large-scale 2-D fracture networks digitized from the well-known Lilstock limestone pavements, Bristol Channel, UK. We consider three large, fractured regions, comprising nearly 300 000 fractures spread over 14 200 m(2) from the Lilstock pavements. Using a moving-window sampling approach, we first subsample the large networks into subgraphs. Four graph similarity measures - fingerprint distance, D-measure, Network Laplacian spectral descriptor (NetLSD), and portrait divergence - that encapsulate topological relationships and geometry of fracture networks are then used to compute pair-wise subgraph distances serving as input for the statistical hierarchical clustering technique. In the form of hierarchical dendrograms and derived spatial variation maps, the results indicate spatial autocorrelation with localized spatial clusters that gradually vary over distances of tens of metres with visually discernable and quantifiable boundaries. Fractures within the identified clusters exhibit differences in fracture orientations and topology. The comparison of graph similarity-derived clusters with fracture persistence measures indicates an intranetwork spatial variation that is not immediately obvious from the ubiquitous fracture intensity and density maps. The proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify spatial variations in fracture networks, guiding stochastic and geostatistical approaches to fracture network modelling.","[Prabhakaran, Rahul; Bertotti, Giovanni] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Prabhakaran, Rahul; Smeulders, David] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Urai, Janos] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Struct Geol Tecton & Geomech, Aachen, Germany",Delft University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology; RWTH Aachen University,"Prabhakaran, R (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Delft, Netherlands.;Prabhakaran, R (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",r.prabhakaran@tudelft.nl,,"Urai, Janos L./0000-0001-5299-6979",,,,,67,7,7,4,12,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1869-9510,1869-9529,,SOLID EARTH,Solid Earth,SEP 30,2021,12,10,,,,,2159,2209,,10.5194/se-12-2159-2021,0.0,,,51,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics,WB9UH,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000703910100001,0

Thanks to advances in online learning systems, however, student data can be automatically collected and used for the investigation and prediction of the students' learning performance. In this article, we present a novel approach to analyse students' learning behaviour, as well as the relationship between these behaviours and learning assessment results, in the context of programming education. A bespoke method has been built based on a combination of Random Matrix Theory, a Community Detection algorithm and statistical hypothesis tests. The datasets contain fine-grained information about students' learning behaviours in two programming courses over two academic years with about 400 first-year students in a Medium-sized Metropolitan University in Dublin. The proposed method is a noval approach to data preprocessing which can improve the analysis and prediction based on learning behavioural datasets. The proposed approach deals with the issues of noise and trend effect in the data and has shown its success in detecting groups of students who have similar learning behaviours and outcomes. The higher performing groups have been found to be more active in practical-related activities throughout the course. Conversely, we found that the lower performing groups engage more with lecture notes instead of doing programming tasks. The learning behaviours data can also be used to predict students' outcomes (i.e. Pass or Fail the terminal exams) at the early stages of the study, using popular machine learning classification techniques.

Furthermore, the algorithm is tightly integrated with an interactive interface which supports the effective exploration of graph data and the labeling of rare categories.

A reachability query from a node at a given start time on such a network retrieves all points of interest (POIs) that are reachable within a given cost budget. Reachability queries are essential building blocks in many applications, for example, group recommendations, ranking spatial queries, or geomarketing. We propose an efficient solution for reachability queries in public transport networks. Currently, there are two options to solve reachability queries. (1) Execute a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that supports time-dependent edge traversal costs; this solution is slow since it must expand edge by edge and does not use an index. (2) Issue a separate path query for each single POI, i.e., a single reachability query requires answering many path queries. None of these solutions scales to large networks with many POIs. We propose a novel and lightweight reachability index. The key idea is to partition the network into cells. Then, in contrast to other approaches, we expand the network cell by cell. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our index-based reachability query solution.","[Tesfaye, Bezaye; Augsten, Nikolaus] Univ Salzburg, Database Res Grp, Salzburg, Austria; [Augsten, Nikolaus] Univ Salzburg, Dept Comp Sci, Salzburg, Austria; [Pawlik, Mateusz] Univ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria; [Boehlen, Michael H.] Univ Zurich, Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Boehlen, Michael H.] Univ Zurich, Database Technol Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jensen, Christian S.] Aalborg Univ, Comp Sci, Aalborg, Denmark",Salzburg University; Salzburg University; Salzburg University; University of Zurich; University of Zurich; Aalborg University,"Tesfaye, B (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Database Res Grp, Salzburg, Austria.",bbelayneh@cs.sbg.ac.at; augsten@cs.sbg.ac.at; mpawlik@cs.sbg.ac.at; boehlen@ifi.uzh.ch; csj@cs.aau.dk,,"Augsten, Nikolaus/0000-0002-3036-6201; Jensen, Christian Sondergaard/0000-0002-9697-7670",Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,Open access funding provided by Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.,,25,1,2,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

In the information explosion era, keyword extraction has attracted increasing attention. The importance of keyword extraction in text summarization, text comparisons, and document categorization has led to an emphasis on graph-based keyword extraction techniques because they can capture more structural information compared to other classic text analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a simple unsupervised text mining approach that aims to extract a set of keywords from a given text and analyze its topic diversity using graph analysis tools. Initially, the text is represented as a directed graph using synonym relationships. Then, community detection and other measures are used to identify keywords in the text. The set of extracted keywords is used to assess topic diversity within the text and analyze its sentiment. The proposed approach relies on grouping semantically similar candidate words.

The increasing need for analyzing billion-scale data calls for faster and more scalable algorithms for these problems. There are certain trade-offs between the quality and speed of such clustering algorithms. In this paper, we design scalable algorithms that achieve high quality when evaluated based on ground truth. We develop a generalized sequential and shared-memory parallel framework based on the LambdaCC objective (introduced by Veldt et al.), which encompasses modularity and correlation clustering. Our framework consists of highly-optimized implementations that scale to large data sets of billions of edges and that obtain high-quality clusters compared to ground-truth data, on both unweighted and weighted graphs. Our empirical evaluation shows that this framework improves the state-of-the-art trade-offs between speed and quality of scalable community detection. For example, on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading, our implementations achieve orders of magnitude speedups over other correlation clustering baselines, and up to 28.44x speedups over our own sequential baselines while maintaining or improving quality.","[Shi, Jessica; Dhulipala, Laxman] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Eisenstat, David; Lacki, Jakub; Mirrokni, Vahab] Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Google Incorporated,"Shi, J (corresponding author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jeshi@mit.edu; laxman@mit.edu; eisen@google.com; jlacki@google.com; mirrokni@google.com,,"Dhulipala, Laxman/0000-0003-0685-064X",NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [1122374],NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by NSF Graduate Research Fellowship #1122374.

Investigating single nucleotide polymorphisms that correlate with specific diseases needs statistical analysis of associations. Considering the huge number of possible mutations, in addition to its high cost, another important drawback of GWAS analysis is the large number of false positives. Thus, researchers search for more evidence to cross-check their results through different sources. To provide the researchers with alternative and complementary low-cost disease-gene association evidence, computational approaches come into play. Since molecular networks are able to capture complex interplay among molecules in diseases, they become one of the most extensively used data for disease-gene association prediction. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of network-based methods for disease gene prediction. We also conduct an empirical analysis on 14 state-of-the-art methods. To summarize, we first elucidate the task definition for disease gene prediction. Secondly, we categorize existing network-based efforts into network diffusion methods, traditional machine learning methods with handcrafted graph features and graph representation learning methods. Thirdly, an empirical analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the selected methods across seven diseases. We also provide distinguishing findings about the discussed methods based on our empirical analysis. Finally, we highlight potential research directions for future studies on disease gene prediction.","[Min Wu] ASTAR, Inst Infocomm Res I2R, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Ata, Sezin Kircali] Nanyang Technol Univ NTU, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Ata, Sezin Kircali] KK Womens & Childrens Hosp, Singapore, Singapore; [Yuan Fang] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Le Ou-Yang] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Kwoh, Chee Keong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Xiao-Li] ASTAR, I2R, Singapore, Singapore",Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R); Nanyang Technological University; KK Women's & Children's Hospital; Singapore Management University; Shenzhen University; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R),"Li, XL (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst Infocomm Res I2R, Singapore 138632, Singapore.",xlli@i2r.a-star.edu.sg,"Kwoh, C K/A-3727-2011; Li, Xiaoli/C-9739-2012; Ata Kircali, Sezin/GXM-7720-2022; Fang, Yuan/AAE-9561-2020; Wu, Min/AAB-2446-2022; Li, Xiaoli/GYQ-7384-2022","Kwoh, C K/0000-0002-8547-6387; Li, Xiaoli/0000-0002-0762-6562; Fang, Yuan/0000-0002-4265-5289; Wu, Min/0000-0003-0977-3600;","Singapore Ministry of Education [2020-T1-001-130(RG15/20), MOE2019-T2-2-175]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515011384]; A*STAR SINGA Scholarship","Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; A*STAR SINGA Scholarship(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR))","This work is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund [Grant numbers: 2020-T1-001-130(RG15/20) and MOE2019-T2-2-175], and the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [Grant number: 2019A1515011384].

An essential step in scRNA-seq data analysis is the annotation of cell types. Traditional cell-type annotation is mainly clustering the cells first, and then using the aggregated cluster-level expression profiles and the marker genes to label each cluster. Such methods are greatly dependent on the clustering results, which are insufficient for accurate annotation. Results: In this article, we propose a semi-supervised learning method for cell-type annotation called CALLR. It combines unsupervised learning represented by the graph Laplacian matrix constructed from all the cells and supervised learning using sparse logistic regression. By alternately updating the cell clusters and annotation labels, high annotation accuracy can be achieved. The model is formulated as an optimization problem, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve it. Experiments on 10 real datasets show that CALLR outperforms the compared (semi-)supervised learning methods, and the popular clustering methods.","[Wei, Ziyang] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wei, Ziyang; Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Lab Math Nonlinear Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Contemporary Appl Math, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Chicago; Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Lab Math Nonlinear Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Contemporary Appl Math, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhangs@fudan.edu.cn,,"ZHANG, SHUQIN/0000-0001-8223-844X",Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [20ZR1407700]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [61932008],Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported, in part, by Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [No. 20ZR1407700] and Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [No. 61932008].",,53,12,12,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1367-4803,1460-2059,,BIOINFORMATICS,Bioinformatics,JUL,2021,37,,,1,,,I51,I58,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab286,0.0,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,US8VF,34252936.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000697703700008,0

The NBNC tuple for a node is asynchronously computed on the basis of the neighborhood graph of the node that comprises of the neighbors of the node as vertices and the links connecting the neighbors as edges. The NBNC tuple for a node has three entries: the number of components in the neighborhood graph of the node, the algebraic connectivity ratio of the neighborhood graph of the node and the number of neighbors of the node.

The quantitative method to detect delayed recognition is described as the pair of Sleeping Beauty (SB) and its Prince (PR), where SB refers to citation bursts and its PR triggers SB's awakeness calculated based on their citation history. This research provides the methods to extract valid and large SB-PR pairs from a comprehensive Scopus dataset and analyses how PR discovers SB. We prove that the proposed method can extract long-sleep and large-scale SB and its PR best covers the previous multi-disciplinary pairs, which enables to observe delayed recognition. Besides, we show that the high-impact SB-PR pairs extracted by the proposed method are more likely to be located in the same field. This indicates that a hidden SB that your research can awaken may exist closer than you think. On the other hand, although SB-PR pairs are fat-tailed in Beauty Coefficient and more likely to integrate separate fields compared to ordinary citations, it is not possible to predict which citation leads to awake SB using the rarity of citation. There is no easy way to limit the areas where SB-PR pairs occur or detect it early, suggesting that researchers and administrators need to focus on a variety of areas.

Juvenile stages of dab (Limanda limanda), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea) present in the English Channel are common in the Seine estuary nursery grounds. To further explore the estuary's nursery function, we investigated the heterogeneity in spatial distribution patterns of these three flatfish at their juvenile stage, between 1996 and 2019. We used geostatistical indices and multivariate analyses to demonstrate species specific spatiotemporal dynamic. Sole favoured the most upstream part of the nursery, dab was found in the most marine areas, and plaice preferred the southern coast. We then performed clusters analysis based on spatial indices and spatial patterns extracted from a Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF). We showed that the average positions of the three flatfish species were stable across time. Each flatfish appeared to have its own spatial preference inside the nursery. No temporal variability in the spatial pattern nor trend was found that would correspond to the major stress imposed on the community by harbour development within the 2000-2005 period. We conclude that segregation of the juveniles of the three species within the nursery may reflect different ecological needs and underlying mechanisms to minimise interspecific competition.","[Cariou, Thibault; Dubroca, Laurent; Vogel, Camille] IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France; [Cariou, Thibault; Bez, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, IRD, CNRS,IFREMER, F-34200 Sete, France",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier,"Cariou, T (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France.",thibault.cariou@gmail.com,"bez, nicolas/IXN-8686-2023","bez, nicolas/0000-0002-3526-671X; Dubroca, Laurent/0000-0002-1861-0507; Vogel, Camille/0000-0002-9590-5982; Cariou, Thibault/0000-0002-7504-6439","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval; IFREMER","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); IFREMER","This work took place during the NOURSEINE project (2017-2019) , funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France.

Parallel and distributed algorithm with high accuracy and low computational complexity is one of the essential issues in the community detection field. In this paper, we propose a novel fast, and accurate Spark-based parallel label diffusion and label selection-based (PLDLS) community detection algorithm with twostep of label diffusion of core nodes along with a new label selection (propagation) method. We have used multi factor criteria for computing node's importance and adopted a new method for selecting core nodes. In the first phase, utilizing the fact that nodes forming triangles, tend to be in the same community, parallel label diffusion of core nodes is performed to diffuse labels up to two levels. In the second phase, through an iterative and parallel process, the most appropriate labels are assigned to the remaining nodes. PLDLS proposes an improved robust version of LPA by putting aside randomness parameter tuning. Furthermore, we utilize a fast and parallel merge phase to get even more dense and accurate communities. Conducted experiments on real-world and artificial networks, indicates the better accuracy and low execution time of PLDLS in comparison with other examined methods.","[Roghani, Hamid; Bouyer, Asgarali; Nourani, Esmaeil] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran",Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University,"Bouyer, A (corresponding author), Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",h.roghani@azaruniv.ac.ir; a.bouyer@azaruniv.ac.ir; ac.nourani@azaruniv.ac.ir,"Bouyer, AsgarAli/JOZ-6483-2023; Roghani, Hamid/GYV-0955-2022; Bouyer, Asgarali/IYS-5116-2023","Roghani, Hamid/0000-0002-8084-5075; Bouyer, Asgarali/0000-0002-4808-2856",,,,,96,22,22,1,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

To connect dynamics and function in systems with these higher-order interactions, network scientists have generalised random-walk models to hypergraphs and studied the multibody effects on flow-based centrality measures. Mapping the large-scale structure of those flows requires effective community detection methods applied to cogent network representations. For different hypergraph data and research questions, which combination of random-walk model and network representation is best? We define unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows and explore how they and the underlying random-walk model change the number, size, depth, and overlap of identified multilevel communities. These results help researchers choose the appropriate modelling approach when mapping flows on hypergraphs. Real-world networks are typically characterised by a non-trivial organization at the mesoscale, such that groups of nodes are preferentially connected within distinguishable network regions known as communities. In this work the authors define unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows to extract the community structure of social and biological systems with higher-order interactions.","[Eriksson, Anton; Edler, Daniel; Rojas, Alexis; Rosvall, Martin] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden; [de Domenico, Manlio] Fondaz Bruno Kessler, CoMuNe Lab, Povo, TN, Italy",Umea University; Fondazione Bruno Kessler,"Eriksson, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden.",anton.eriksson@umu.se,"Rojas, Alexis/JFK-9462-2023; Holmgren, Anton/GWZ-2857-2022; Edler, Daniel/AAE-7215-2020; De Domenico, Manlio/B-5826-2014; Rosvall, Martin/A-9488-2015","Rojas, Alexis/0000-0002-1063-9102; Holmgren, Anton/0000-0001-5859-4073; Edler, Daniel/0000-0001-5420-0591; Rosvall, Martin/0000-0002-7181-9940",Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research [SB16-0089]; Swedish Research Council [2018-05973]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) [SB16-0089] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF),Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic ResearchSwedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"We thank Christopher Blocker, Leyden Fernandez, Viktor Jonsson, Michael Schaub, Jelena Smiljanic and Alexander Vergara for valuable comments that helped us improve the manuscript.

Recently, graph wavelet neural network (GWNN) has made a significant improvement for this task. However, GWNN is usually shallow based on a one-or two hop neighborhood structure, making it unable to obtain sufficient global information to make it better. But, if GWNN merely stacks too many convolutional layers, it produces the phenomenon of the wavelet convolutional filters over-smoothing. To stack this challenge, we propose Multi-granularity Graph Wavelet Neural Networks (M-GWNN), a novel spectral GCNs architecture that leverages the proposed Louvain-variant algorithm and the jump connection to improve the ability of node representations for semi-supervised node classification. We first repeatedly apply the proposed Louvain-variant algorithm to aggregate nodes into supernodes to build a hierarchy of successively coarser graph, further refine the coarsened graph symmetrically back to the original by utilizing the jump connection. Moreover, during this process, multiple layers of GWNN are applied to propagate information across entire networks. The proposed M-GWNN efficiently captures node features and graph topological structures of varying granularity to obtain global information. Furthermore, M-GWNN effectively employs the jump connection to connect receptive fields of varying granularity to alleviate the speed of over-smoothing. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed M-GWNN. Particularly, when only a few labeled nodes are provided on the NELL dataset, M-GWNN achieves up to an average 5.7% performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.

For effective decision making, models must be able to forecast the outcome of each option and determine which option is the best for a particular situation. In this context, community evolution prediction is a challenging and time-consuming task, which is the extraction of structural features from large real-world networks. We present AFIF, Automatically Finding Important Features, an efficient solution to examine communities' structural features and also to find a proper subset of promising features in order to predict the upcoming changes of social networks. AFIF combines two key concepts to find prominent features: (i) Prioritization of attributes based on their Spearman's correlation with other features. This enables us to know the features that can represent the rest and to explore which features are unique compared to others. (ii) Training a boosting learner and prioritizing attributes based on their usage frequency in learning process to realize which features are more valuable. Eventually, important features are determined by random forest classifier. We have then conducted extensive experiments and confirmed that our selection of features delivers an outstanding performance in contrast with using the entire set of features.","[Mohammadmosaferi, Kaveh Kadkhoda; Naderi, Hassan] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Naderi, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",k_kadkhoda@cmps2.iust.ac.ir; naderi@iust.ac.ir,"Kadkhoda, Kaveh/HKE-1084-2023; naderi, hassan/S-9556-2018","naderi, hassan/0000-0002-3296-8505; Kadkhoda, Kaveh/0000-0002-1313-9218",,,,,61,2,2,0,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0140-3664,1873-703X,,COMPUT COMMUN,Comput.

Our experiments are based on a parallel corpus which allows us to represent each language as a co-occurrence network. Four methods to calculate network modularity, as a measure of the quality of community structure, were used. We studied several aspects of the community structure of co-occurrence networks. First, we were able to construct the map of modularity variations across languages from the Americas. With this, we separated large groups of languages into low- and high-modularity families. We suggested also a strong influence of functional words on low-modularity languages. Finally, we found a strong relationship between word entropy values and modularity. Our approach is thus a simple network-based contribution to face data scarcity of languages which are in danger of disappearing.

Further supporting this insight, we find that while communities present in the global collaboration network before 2000 were often based on historical geopolitical or colonial lines, in more recent years they increasingly align with a simple partition of countries by regions. These findings are unexpected in light of a presumed continual increase in globalisation, and have significant implications for the design of programmes aimed at promoting international research collaboration and knowledge diffusion.","[Fitzgerald, John; Ojanpera, Sanna; O'Clery, Neave] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Radcliffe Observ, Andrew Wiles Bldg, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Ojanpera, Sanna] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, ASD, Oxford, England; [O'Clery, Neave] UCL, Bartlett Ctr Adv Spatial Anal, London, England; [Ojanpera, Sanna; O'Clery, Neave] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; University College London,"Fitzgerald, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Radcliffe Observ, Andrew Wiles Bldg, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",fitzgeraldj@maths.ox.ac.uk,,"Fitzgerald, John/0000-0002-0549-8130; Ojanpera, Sanna/0000-0001-7993-9114",EPSRC Centre For Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling [EP/L015803/1]; Alan Turing Institute doctoral grant [TU/C/000020]; PEAK Urban programme - UKRI's Global Challenge Research Fund [ES/P011055/1]; Elsevier; GCRF [ES/P011055/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC Centre For Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Alan Turing Institute doctoral grant; PEAK Urban programme - UKRI's Global Challenge Research Fund(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); Elsevier; GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This publication is based on work partially supported by the EPSRC Centre For Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (EP/L015803/1) in collaboration with Elsevier (John Fitzgerald).

This paper derives the best-fitting distance decay function to capture the spatial behaviors of cancer patients in the Northeast region of the U.S., and examines and explains the spatial variability of such behaviors across sub-regions. Principal results: (1) 46.8%, 85.5%, and 99.6% of cancer care received was within a driving time of 30, 60, and 180 min, respectively. (2) The exponential distance decay function is the best in capturing the travel behavior of cancer patients in the region and across most sub-regions. (3) The friction coefficient in the distance decay function is negatively correlated with the mean travel time. (4) The best-fitting function forms are associated with network structures. (5) The variation of the friction coefficient across sub-regions is related to factors such as urbanicity, economic development level, and market competition intensity. Major conclusions: The distance decay function offers an analytic metric to capture a full spectrum of travel behavior, and thus a more comprehensive measure than average travel time. Examining the geographic variation of travel behavior needs a reliable analysis unit such as organically defined cancer service areas, which capture relevant health care market structure and thus are more meaningful than commonly-used geopolitical or census area units.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,"Wang, Fahui/AAF-4700-2022; Wang, Changzhen/HPH-2043-2023; Wang, Fahui/H-4302-2013","Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024; Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024; Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",,,,,55,17,19,6,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-367X,2214-3688,,TRAVEL BEHAV SOC,Travel Behav.

For many of these molecules, property data have not been measured yet and need to be estimated to determine suitability to a particular application. For example, viscosity is a key property in the development of green solvents, fuel additives, and biofuels. This paper proposes the use of modularity as a molecular descriptor combined with functional group counts to estimate molecular properties using neural network models. The modularity of molecules was determined from graph representations using community detection algorithms. The potential for this approach was demonstrated for the modeling of viscosity at 25 degrees C and applied to biomass-derived molecules. The model performances showed that including modularity contributed to more accurate estimations than viscosity models existing in the literature. Furthermore, modularity on its own can be useful to estimate viscosity for n-alkanes, esters, isoalkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, and cycloalkanes. This was due to the capacity of modularity to capture the structural features of the molecules employed in the data set. As such, modularity exhibited its tremendous potential to be exploited for property estimation, supporting the screening, rational design, and engineering of green chemicals derived from biomass.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Valencia, Diego; Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero; Aburto, Jorge] Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico; [Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Chem, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021; Aburto, Jorge/B-4600-2009","MARTINEZ HERNANDEZ, ELIAS/0000-0002-2789-7239; Aburto, Jorge/0000-0002-8282-6046; Valencia, Diego/0000-0002-2877-2841",[D.61074],,The authors would like to acknowledge Project D.61074 (IMP) for financial support.,,36,9,9,1,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Suitably conducted community detection reveals various embedded informative substructures of network topology. However, regarding the practical usage of community detection, it has always been a tricky problem to assign a reasonable community resolution for networks of interest. Because of the absence of the unanimously accepted criterion, most of the previous studies utilized rather ad hoc heuristics to decide the community resolution. In this work, we harness the concept of consistency in community structures of networks to provide the overall community resolution landscape of networks, which we eventually take to quantify the reliability of detected communities for a given resolution parameter. More precisely, we exploit the ambiguity in the results of stochastic detection algorithms and suggest a method that denotes the relative validity of community structures in regard to their stability of global and local inconsistency measures using multiple detection processes. Applying our framework to synthetic and real networks, we confirm that it effectively displays insightful fundamental aspects of community structures.","[Lee, Daekyung; Kim, Beom Jun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile.",lshlj82@gnu.ac.kr; kimheetae@gmail.com,,"Kim, Heetae/0000-0002-5688-2626; Lee, Sang Hoon/0000-0003-3079-5679","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [20194010000290]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2018R1C1B5083863, NRF-2021R1C1C1004132]; National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT [11190096]","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of KoreaKorea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation & Planning (KETEP)); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT","D.L. and B.J.K. were supported by Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), granted financial resource from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea (Grant No. 20194010000290), S.H.L. was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea Grants No. NRF-2018R1C1B5083863 and No. NRF-2021R1C1C1004132, and H.K. was supported by the National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT No. 11190096.",,31,8,8,0,10,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",2470-0045,2470-0053,,PHYS REV E,Phys.

Categorization of M&A is important to both corporate strategy and academic research. Previous research largely uses case studies and econometric data analysis to classify the motivations and types of M&A. Here, we propose understanding M&A using large-scale data to generate more applicable and generalized results. We use transaction relationships from transaction networks to better understand M&A. Based on detailed pre-analysis, including matching M&A and transaction data from Japan and clustering of transaction networks, we select several M&A observation perspectives. We use two features of transaction networks to categorize M&A cases: betweenness centrality and shortest path length. Betweenness centrality provides a view of the overall business situation from a macro perspective, and shortest path length helps to understand neighboring business environments from a micro perspective. We find several meaningful areas of concentration based on their betweenness centrality values and shortest path lengths. Finally, we reexamine M&A cases in each area, summarizing the trends identified using this categorization method. This study contributes to the M&A literature because it advances quantitative categorization of M&A cases.","[Shao, Bohua; Asatani, Kimitaka; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Sasaki, Hajime; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Shao, BH (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",shaobohua6@gmail.com,,"Shao, Bohua/0000-0003-1489-6226; Sasaki, Hajime/0000-0003-0026-4076; Asatani, Kimitaka/0000-0003-3595-8940",,,,,45,5,5,4,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0275-5319,1878-3384,,RES INT BUS FINANC,Res.

Combining prior knowledge, in silico analyses, and in situ validation, our multi-informatic investigation describes the molecular landscape from a single developmental snapshot. 17 markers are identified to differentiate distinct maturation stages. 30 markers are identified to specify the stem cell origin and/or cell division numbers of INPs, and at least 12 neuronal subtypes are identified.

Many biological networks-such as those that represent regulatory interactions, drug-gene, or gene-disease associations-are of a bipartite nature, meaning they consist of two different types of nodes, with connections only forming between the different node sets. Analysis of such networks requires methodologies that are specifically designed to handle their bipartite nature. Community structure detection is a method used to identify clusters of nodes in a network. This approach is especially helpful in large-scale biological network analysis, as it can find structure in networks that often resemble a hairball of interactions in visualizations. Often, the communities identified in biological networks are enriched for specific biological processes and thus allow one to assign drugs, regulatory molecules, or diseases to such processes. In addition, comparison of community structures between different biological conditions can help to identify how network rewiring may lead to tissue development or disease, for example. In this mini review, we give a theoretical basis of different methods that can be applied to detect communities in bipartite biological networks. We introduce and discuss different scores that can be used to assess the quality of these community structures. We then apply a wide range of methods to a drug-gene interaction network to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these methods in their application to large-scale, bipartite biological networks.","[Calderer, Genis; Kuijjer, Marieke L.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Mol Med Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Kuijjer, Marieke L.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Oslo; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Kuijjer, ML (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Mol Med Norway, Oslo, Norway.;Kuijjer, ML (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Leiden, Netherlands.",marieke.kuijjer@ncmm.uio.no,"kuijjer, marieke/AAG-5844-2019","kuijjer, marieke/0000-0001-6280-3130","Norwegian Research Council, Helse Sor-Ost; University of Oslo through the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM)","Norwegian Research Council, Helse Sor-Ost(Research Council of Norway); University of Oslo through the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM)","This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council, Helse Sor-Ost, and University of Oslo through the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM).",,47,7,9,0,27,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

We describe standard preprocessing and statistical analyses of data obtained from such techniques and highlight some computational challenges relative to the sequencing of individual cells. We notably provide examples of gene expression analyses such as differential expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering and enrichment analysis. Additionally, we used public data sets to exemplify how deconvolution algorithms can identify and quantify multiple immune subpopulations from either bulk or single-cell RNAseq.

Moreover, the effect of SNSs on opinion polarisation is still unclear in terms of pluralistic information access or selective exposure to opinions in an SNS. In this study, we confirmed the steady, highly independent nature of left- and right-leaning ECs, both of which are composed of approximately 250,000 users, from a year-long reply/retweet network of 42 million Japanese Twitter users. We found that both communities have similarly efficient information spreading networks with densely connected and core-periphery structures. Core nodes resonate in the early stages of information cascades, and unilaterally transmit information to peripheral nodes. Each EC has resonant core users who amplify and steadily spread information to a quarter of a million users. In addition, we confirmed the existence of extremely aggressive users of ECs who co-reply/retweet each other. The connection between these users and top influencers suggests that the extreme opinions of the former group affect the entire community through the top influencers.","[Asatani, Kimitaka; Sakaki, Takeshi; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yamano, Hiroko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Asatani, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",asatani@ipr-ctr.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Asatani, Kimitaka/0000-0003-3595-8940",,,,,59,7,7,6,27,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,APR 5,2021,11,1,,,,,,,7491,10.1038/s41598-021-86750-w,0.0,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,RJ7YA,33820918.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000637816800016,0

In the practical work, we have noted that every node and its most similar node tend to be assigned to the same community and that two communities are often merged together if there exist relatively more edges between them. Inspired by these observations, we present a community-detection method named NSCLS in this paper. Firstly, we calculate the similarities between any node and its first- and second-order neighbors in a novel way and then extract the initial communities from the network by allocating every node and its most similar node to the same community. In this procedure, some nodes located at the community boundaries might be classified in the incorrect communities. To make a redemption, we adjust their community affiliations by reclassifying each of them into the community in which most of its neighbors have been. After that, there might exist relatively larger number of edges between some communities.

To this end, we calculate the link strength between communities and merge some densely connected communities based on this index. We evaluate NSCLS on both some synthetic networks and some real-world networks and show that it can detect high-quality community structures from various networks, and its results are much better than the counterparts of comparison algorithms.","[Yang, Haijuan; Cheng, Jianjun; Yang, Zeyi; Zhang, Handong; Zhang, Wenbo; Yang, Ke; Chen, Xiaoyun] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haijuan] Lanzhou Vocat Tech Coll, Dept Elect Informat Engn, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Cheng, JJ; Chen, XY (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",chengjianjun@lzu.edu.cn; chenxy@lzu.edu.cn,"liu, feng/KCL-0778-2024; XIN, WANG/KGK-5385-2024","Cheng, Jianjun/0000-0002-0044-0861",Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China [20JR5RA284],Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China,This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province of China (Grant no. 20JR5RA284).,,52,5,5,0,18,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,MAR 13,2021,2021,,,,,,,,8848566,10.1155/2021/8848566,0.0,,,17,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,RB1UG,,gold,,,2024-08-21,WOS:000631900800002,0

However, leukemia tumor heterogeneity complicates integration of DNA variants and immunophenotypes from separate measurements. Here we introduce DAb-seq, a technology for simultaneous capture of DNA genotype and cell surface phenotype from single cells at high throughput, enabling direct profiling of proteogenomic states in tens of thousands of cells. To demonstrate the approach, we analyze the disease of three patients with leukemia over multiple treatment timepoints and disease recurrences. We observe complex genotype-phenotype dynamics that illustrate the subtlety of the disease process and the degree of incongruity between blast cell genotype and phenotype in different clinical scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of combined single-cell DNA and protein measurements to fully characterize the heterogeneity of leukemia. It is currently difficult to map DNA variants and surface phenotypes in the same cells, preventing direct linkage of phenotype and genotype. Here the authors report DAb-seq for simultaneous capture of DNA genotype and cell surface phenotype from single cells at high throughput.","[Demaree, Benjamin; Delley, Cyrille L.; Vasudevan, Harish N.; Abate, Adam R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Demaree, Benjamin; Abate, Adam R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UC Berkeley UCSF Grad Program Bioengn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Vasudevan, Harish N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Radiat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Peretz, Cheryl A.

The results demonstrate that the performance and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm are reproducible, stable, and better than those of single-objective clustering methods.

From the data, four key target variables are chosen: HIV status, injecting drug use, homelessness, and insurance status. These target variables are converted to a graph format using four separate graph inference techniques: graphical lasso, Meinshausen Buhlmann (MB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and correlation thresholding (CT). The graphs are then clustered using four clustering methods: Louvain, Leiden, and NBR-Clust with VAT and integrity. Promising clusters are chosen using internal evaluation measures and are visualized and analyzed to identify marker attributes and key relationships. The kNN and CT inference methods are shown to give useful results when combined with NBR-Clust clustering.

When the network was compared with simulated models, it was observed that the EAN had small-world and scale-free properties. To measure the hub performance of the airports, their binary betweenness centrality was compared with a weighted betweenness measure employing the ratio of geographical distance to passenger traffic between the nodes.

For large networks, there is the additional requirement of speed. In this context, the so-called label propagation algorithm (LPA) was proposed, which runs in near-linear time. In partitions uncovered by LPA, each node is ensured to have most links to its assigned community. We here propose a fast variant of LPA (FLPA) that is based on processing a queue of nodes whose neighbourhood recently changed. We test FLPA exhaustively on benchmark networks and empirical networks, finding that it can run up to 700 times faster than LPA. In partitions found by FLPA, we prove that each node is again guaranteed to have most links to its assigned community.

This is a quality func-tion which evaluates a label assignment against an arbitrary block pattern. Therefore, unlike standard modularity or its variants, arbitrary network structures can be compared and an optimal block matrix can be determined. Some simple algorithms for optimising block modularity are described and applied on networks with planted structure. In many cases the planted structure is recovered. Cases where it is not are analysed and it is found that strong degree-correlations explain the planted structure so that the discovered pattern is more 'surprising' than the planted one under the configuration model.

The authors show that the stock returns of companies that are connected through the supply chain network exhibit a correlation struc-ture that differs significantly from that of random pairs of stocks. This effect is observed for companies that are connected directly as well as through a common third party. A clustering approach is used to yield some interesting easier-to-exploit results with a view toward risk modeling. The authors also perform an analysis of rare negative events, highlighting some lead-lag relationships.","[Abergel, Frederic; Akar, Adrien] BNP Paribas Asset Management, Paris, France",BNP Paribas,"Abergel, F (corresponding author), BNP Paribas Asset Management, Paris, France.",frederic.abergel@bnpparibas.com; adrien.akar@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,PAGEANT MEDIA LTD,LONDON,"ONE LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND",0095-4918,2168-8656,,J PORTFOLIO MANAGE,J.

In this work, we study the problem of quantifying the significance of edges in a complex network, and propose a significantly improved version of the Link Entropy method. Using Louvain, Leiden and Walktrap methods, our proposal detects the number of communities in each iteration on discovering the communities. Running experiments on various benchmark networks, we show that our proposed method outperforms the Link Entropy method in quantifying edge significance. Considering also the computational complexities and possible defects, we conclude that Leiden or Louvain algorithms are the best choice for community number detection in quantifying edge significance. We also discuss designing a new algorithm for not only discovering the number of communities, but also computing the community membership uncertainties.","[Lubashevskiy, Vasily; Ozaydin, Fatih] Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, 1-13-1 Matoba-kita, Kawagoe, Saitama 3501197, Japan; [Ozaydin, Seval Yurtcicek] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social & Human Sci, 2-12-1 Ookayama,Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Ozaydin, Fatih] CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",Tokyo International University; Tokyo Institute of Technology; European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),"Lubashevskiy, V (corresponding author), Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, 1-13-1 Matoba-kita, Kawagoe, Saitama 3501197, Japan.",vlubashe@tiu.ac.jp,"Lubashevskiy, Vasily/JTU-7139-2023; Ozaydin, Fatih/F-9338-2014","Lubashevskiy, Vasily/0000-0002-2399-5050; Yurtcicek Ozaydin, Seval/0000-0003-2429-0631; Ozaydin, Fatih/0000-0002-5872-9158",,,,,63,1,1,3,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,FEB,2023,25,2.0,,,,,,,365,10.3390/e25020365,0.0,,,15,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,9H1OC,36832730.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-21,WOS:000938607900001,0
