J,"Yin, DH",,,,"Yin, Dehu",,,Quantitative Analysis of Scholars' Topic Switching Behavior in Computer Science: A Two-Dimensional Metric Approach,IEEE ACCESS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bibliographic coupling networks; topic switching behavior; Louvain algorithm; research performance,EVOLUTION; GRAPH,"Computer science (CS) plays a crucial role in addressing challenges across various sectors, including education, finance, and healthcare. Investigating scholars' topic switching behavior quantitatively is essential for understanding the driving forces behind technological development in CS. However, the continuous growth of scientific publications poses challenges in accurately tracking scholars' topic switching. To address this, this study utilizes a large-scale dataset from the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) to construct bibliographic coupling networks for 16,794 scholars, enabling the detection of their research topics using the Louvain algorithm. Subsequently, this study introduces a novel two-dimensional metric to quantify scholars' topic switching behavior: topic switching degree and topic switching probability. This metric enables the classification of scholars into four distinct types: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Our analysis reveals that the majority of scholars belong to Type B, characterized by high topic switching probability but low degree, correlating with the highest quantity, quality, and citations of publications. Scholars categorized as Type A and Type D follow, while those falling under Type C, indicating low topic switching probability but high degree, tend to have the lowest publications and citations. Employing these new two-dimensional indicators to measure scholars' topic switching behavior and exploring its relationship with research performance contribute to advancements in technology within the field of computer science.","[Yin, Dehu] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Yin, DH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",1019209055@tju.edu.cn,"Yin, Dehu/JTT-2792-2023",,The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program [20220615ZZ07110404],The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program,This work was supported by the 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program under Grant 20220615ZZ07110404.,,52,0,0,5,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,,104263.0,104271.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434546,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,C0V8F,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001286635200001,0,"Computer Science, Information Systems"

While most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network. Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial differences in community detection such as users' tendencies toward preferential attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect of users' location and primary programming language, which was determined using a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts and network scholars interested in studying team formation.","[Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz] James Madison Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Kramer, Brandon L.; Calderon, J.

In recent years, spatial community detection has attracted extensive research in the field of geographic information science. However, mining the community structures and their evolutionary patterns from spatial interaction data remains challenging. Most existing methods for spatial community detection rely on representing spatial interaction networks in Euclidean space, which results in significant distortion when modeling spatial interaction networks; since spatial community detection has no ground truth, this results in the detection and evaluation of communities being difficult. Furthermore, most methods usually ignore the dynamics of these spatial interaction networks, resulting in the dynamic evolution of spatial communities not being discussed in depth. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for community detection and evolutionary analysis for spatial interaction networks. Specifically, we construct a spatial interaction network based on network science theory, where geographic units serve as nodes and interaction relationships serve as edges. In order to fully learn the structural features of the spatial interaction network, we introduce a hyperbolic graph convolution module in the community detection phase to learn the spatial and non-spatial attributes of the spatial interaction network, obtain vector representations of the nodes, and optimize them based on a graph generation model to achieve the final community detection results. Considering the dynamics of spatial interactions, we analyze the evolution of the spatial community over time. Finally, using taxi trajectory data as an example, we conduct relevant experiments within the fifth ring road of Beijing. The empirical results validate the community detection capabilities of the proposed method, which can effectively describe the dynamic spatial structure of cities based on human mobility and provide an effective analytical method for urban spatial planning.","[Liu, Huimin; Yang, Qiu; Yang, Xuexi; Tang, Jianbo; Deng, Min; Gui, Rong] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Huimin; Yang, Xuexi; Tang, Jianbo; Deng, Min] Hunan Geospatial Informat Engn & Technol Res Ctr, Changsha 410018, Peoples R China; [Deng, Min] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R China",Central South University; Jiangxi Normal University,"Gui, R (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",lhmgis@csu.edu.cn; 215011045@csu.edu.cn; yangxuexi@csu.edu.cn; jianbo.tang@csu.edu.cn; dengmin@csu.edu.cn; ronggui@csu.edu.cn,,"Gui, Rong/0000-0001-8470-3405; Liu, Huimin/0000-0002-7419-5838; Xuexi, Yang/0000-0001-5531-5841","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2022JJ40585]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271485, 42171459]; Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University [2023QYJC002]; Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project [20230121XX]; Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents [jxsq2020102062]",Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University; Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project; Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents,"This research was supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2022JJ40585), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42271485 and 42171459), the Frontier Cross Research Project of Central South University (2023QYJC002), the Hunan Province Natural Resources Science and Technology Project (20230121XX), and the Jiangxi Province Double Thousand Plan the third batch of short-term projects to introduce innovative leading talents (jxsq2020102062).",,52,0,0,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Analysis of these datasets is challenging because gene expression values are highly sparse due to dropout events, and there is a lack of tools to facilitate in silico detection and annotation of regions based on their molecular content. Therefore, we develop a computational tool for detecting molecular regions and region-based Missing value Imputation for Spatially Transcriptomics (MIST). We validate MIST-identified regions across multiple datasets produced by 10x Visium Spatial Transcriptomics, using manually annotated histological images as references. We benchmark MIST against a spatial k-nearest neighboring baseline and other imputation methods designed for single-cell RNA sequencing. We use holdout experiments to demonstrate that MIST accurately recovers spatial transcriptomics missing values. MIST facilitates identifying intra-tissue heterogeneity and recovering spatial gene-gene co-expression signals. Using MIST before downstream analysis thus provides unbiased region detections to facilitate annotations with the associated functional analyses and produces accurately denoised spatial gene expression profiles. Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a relatively new technique that maps transcriptional information within a tissue. Here the authors present MIST, which detects molecular regions from spatially resolved transcriptomics and denoises the missing gene expression values by region-specific imputation.","[Wang, Linhua] Baylor Coll Med, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Program Quantitat & Computat Biosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana; Liu, Zhandong] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana; Liu, Zhandong] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College Medical Hospital; Baylor College of Medicine,"Liu, ZD (corresponding author), Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Liu, ZD (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",zhandonl@bcm.edu,"Wang, Linhua/GRR-3312-2022","Wang, Linhua/0000-0002-6717-860X; Maletic-Savatic, Mirjana/0000-0002-6548-4662; Liu, Zhandong/0000-0002-7608-0831",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [P50HD103555]; Chao Endowment,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health; Chao Endowment,Research reported in this publication was partially supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number P50HD103555 for use of the Bioinformatics Core facilities.

However, this topic has not been investigated in detail. This study, first, deploys science mapping techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output, impact, and structure of the Colombian scientific elite, i.e., researchers awarded with the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize 1990-2020, known locally as the Colombian Nobel. Second, we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990-2020 via the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al. Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases. The Colombian scientific elite also showed positive growth, which is an inverse trend compared with the sample of Nobel laureate productivity. There were no noticeable changes in productivity/impact before and after receiving the Alejandro angel Escobar Foundation National Prize. Institutional collaboration within the Colombian scientific elite displayed the highest betweenness (brokerage) role of world/local top-tier universities. However, only two Colombian scientific elite members published an article with two Nobel Prize laureates. Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities, but were found to diverge from the national focus in respect of strategic research capacities. The interleaving of the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates-particularly between the 3(rd) and 2(nd) quartiles-enabled a more nuanced analysis of the local impact in the global scientific landscape. Our findings also contrast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America, despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals, and also shed light on the research performance-impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in-context assessment of outstanding local research.","[Cortes, Julian D.] Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Julian D.] Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cortes, Julian D.] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India",Universidad del Rosario; Fudan University; Woxsen University,"Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Sch Management & Business, Bogota, Colombia.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Cortes, JD (corresponding author), Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India.",julian.cortess@urosario.edu.co,"Cortés, Julián/B-7716-2016; Andrade, Daniel/HTN-1967-2023","Cortes, Julian D./0000-0002-1246-2160",,,,,122,7,7,4,25,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17.0,5.0,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0269116,0.0,,,34,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3L8YU,35617365.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000835048800039,0,Multidisciplinary Sciences

While individual microbial species have been found to be associated with certain disease states, increasing evidence suggests that higher-order microbial interactions may have an equal or greater contribution to host fitness. To better understand microbial community dynamics, we utilize networks to study interactions through a meta-analysis of microbial association networks between healthy and disease gut microbiomes. Taking advantage of the large number of metagenomes derived from healthy individuals and patients with various diseases, together with recent advances in network inference that can deal with sparse compositional data, we inferred microbial association networks based on co-occurrence of gut microbial species and made the networks publicly available as a resource (GitHub repository named GutNet). Through our meta-analysis of inferred networks, we were able to identify network-associated features that help stratify between healthy and disease states such as the differentiation of various bacterial phyla and enrichment of Proteobacteria interactions in diseased networks. Additionally, our findings show that the contributions of taxa in microbial associations are disproportionate to their abundances and that rarer taxa of microbial species play an integral part in shaping dynamics of microbial community interactions. Network-based meta-analysis revealed valuable insights into microbial community dynamics between healthy and disease phenotypes. We anticipate that the healthy and diseased microbiome association networks we inferred will become an important resource for human-related microbiome research.","[Lam, Tony J.; Ye, Yuzhen] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ye, YZ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",yye@indiana.edu,,,NIH [R01AI143254]; NSF [EF-2025451],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The NIH grant R01AI143254 and NSF grant EF-2025451.,,58,12,12,2,13,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,OCT 19,2022,12.0,1,,,,,,,17482,10.1038/s41598-022-22541-1,0.0,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,5L5BC,36261472.0,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000870427800084,0,Multidisciplinary Sciences

To help improve the current breast cancer comorbidity identification by medical personnel and ultimately, lower the number of death cases from breast cancer comorbidity, this research aims to discover the breast cancer comorbidity community, do modularity and similarity-based evaluation, suggest the best semantic similarity measurement and threshold value, and validate the data of breast cancer comorbidities with several data from research papers. The Wang algorithm, with a threshold value of 0.5, is chosen to build the network. Leiden, Louvain, RBER Pots, RB Pots, and Walktrap are the best five community detection algorithms. Similarity measurements with the best three fitness functions (edges inside, scaled density, and size) suggest that the Leiden-Louvain algorithm and RBER Pots-RB Pots algorithm are two pairs of algorithms with similar results. Other similarity measurements with the V-measure heatmap suggest that Louvain-Leiden (0.99), RB Pots-Leiden (0.97), and RB Pots-RBER Pots (0.96) results are similar.

These technologies are, however, destructive to cells and tissues, raising practical challenges when aiming to track dynamic biological processes. As the same cell cannot be observed at multiple time points, as it changes in time and space in response to a stimulus or perturbation, these large-scale measurements only produce unaligned data sets. In this Primer, we show how such challenges can be effectively addressed using the unifying framework of optimal transport theory and tackled using the many algorithms that have been proposed for the range of scenarios of key interest in computational biology. We further review recent advances integrating optimal transport and deep learning that allow forecasting heterogeneous cellular dynamics and behaviour, crucial in particular for pressing problems in personalized medicine. The optimal transport mathematical framework can be used to describe how source populations, such as populations of single cells, can morph into another target population. In this Primer, Bunne et al. describe how optimal transport theory is used for analysing single-cell data.","[Bunne, Charlotte; Krause, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bunne, Charlotte; Regev, Aviv] Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Schiebinger, Geoffrey] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Cuturi, Marco] Apple, Paris, France",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Roche Holding; Genentech; Roche Holding USA; University of British Columbia,"Bunne, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Bunne, C (corresponding author), Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.;Cuturi, M (corresponding author), Apple, Paris, France.",charlotte.bunne@epfl.ch; cuturi@apple.com,,"Bunne, Charlotte/0000-0003-1431-103X; Cuturi, Marco/0000-0002-1934-0588",NCCR Catalysis [180544]; National Centre of Competence in Research - Swiss National Science Foundation,NCCR Catalysis; National Centre of Competence in Research - Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This publication was supported by the NCCR Catalysis (grant number 180544), a National Centre of Competence in Research funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,213,0,0,7,7,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-8449,,NAT REV METHOD PRIME,Nat.

However, they face two major challenges: 1) existing synchronized distributed frameworks require continuous communication to access information from other machines, and 2) the inability of current partitioning methods to ensure that subgraphs remain connected components without isolated nodes, which is essential for effective training of GNNs since training relies on information aggregation from neighboring nodes. To address these issues, we introduce a novel partitioning method, named Leiden-Fusion, designed for large-scale training of graphs with minimal communication. Our method extends the Leiden community detection algorithm with a greedy algorithm that merges the smallest communities with highly connected neighboring communities. Our method guarantees that, for an initially connected graph, each partition is a densely connected subgraph with no isolated nodes. After obtaining the partitions, we train a GNN for each partition independently, and finally integrate all embeddings for node classification tasks, which significantly reduces the need for network communication and enhances the efficiency of distributed graph training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets, achieving high efficiency while preserving the quality of the graph embeddings for node classification tasks.","[Bai, Yuhe; Constantin, Camelia; Naacke, Hubert] Sorbonne Univ, LIP6, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Naacke, H (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, LIP6, Paris, France.",yuhe.bai@lip6.fr; camelia.constantin@lip6.fr; hubert.naacke@lip6.fr,,,"SCAI (Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence) at Sorbonne University, France","SCAI (Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence) at Sorbonne University, France","This work is funded by the SCAI (Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence) at Sorbonne University, France.",,21,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-031-70367-6; 978-3-031-70368-3,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2024,14947.0,,,,,,366.0,382.0,,10.1007/978-3-031-70368-3_22,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX6FP,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001308377300022,0,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence"

While most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network. Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial differences in community detection such as users' tendencies toward preferential attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect of users' location and primary programming language, which was determined using a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts and network scholars interested in studying team formation.","[Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz] James Madison Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Kramer, Brandon L.; Calderon, J.

We extend this geometry to a hypersphere and prove that maximizing modularity is equivalent to minimizing the angular distance to some modularity vector over the set of clustering vectors. In that sense, modularity-based community detection methods can be seen as a subclass of a more general class of projection methods, which we define as the community detection methods that adhere to the following two-step procedure: first, mapping the network to a point on the hypersphere; second, projecting this point to the set of clustering vectors. We show that this class of projection methods contains many interesting community detection methods. Many of these new methods cannot be described in terms of null models and resolution parameters, as is customary for modularity-based methods. We provide a new characterization of such methods in terms of meridians and latitudes of the hypersphere. In addition, by relating the modularity resolution parameter to the latitude of the corresponding modularity vector, we obtain a new interpretation of the resolution limit that modularity maximization is known to suffer from.","[Gosgens, Martijn; van der Hofstad, Remco; Litvak, Nelly] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Litvak, Nelly] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; University of Twente,"Gösgens, M (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",RESEARCH@MARTIJNGOSGENS.NL; R.W.V.D.HOFSTAD@TUE.NL; N.LITVAK@UTWENTE.NL,"van der harst, pim/G-1993-2010",,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS [024.002.003],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work is supported in part by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS grant no. 024.002.003.,,60,1,1,1,2,MICROTOME PUBL,BROOKLINE,"31 GIBBS ST, BROOKLINE, MA 02446 USA",1532-4435,,,J MACH LEARN RES,J.

Bad actors abuse policies and services like claims, coupons, payouts, etc., to gain material benefits. These fraudsters often work collusively (rings), and it is difficult to identify underlying relationships between them when analyzing individual actors. Fraud rings identification can be modeled as a community detection problem on graphs where nodes are the actors, and the edges represent common attributes between them. However, the challenge lies in incorporating the attributes' domain-informed importance and hierarchy in coming up with edge weights. Treating all edge types as equal (and binary) can be fairly naive; we show that using domain knowledge considerably outperforms other methods. For community detection itself, while the weight information is expected to be learned automatically in deep learning-based methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), it is explicitly provided in traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a scalable and extensible end-to-end framework based on domain-aware weighted community detection to detect fraud rings. We first convert a multi-edge weighted graph into a homogeneous weighted graph and perform domain-aware edge-weight optimization to maximize modularity using the Leiden community detection algorithm. We then use features of communities and nodes to classify both community and a node as fraud or not. We show that our methods achieve up to 9.92% lift in F1-score on internal data, which is significant at our scale, and up to 4.81% F1-score lift on two open datasets (Amazon, Yelp) vs. an XGBoost based baseline.","[Masihullah, Shaik; Negi, Meghana; Matthew, Jose; Sathyanarayana, Jairaj] Swiggy, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Negi, M (corresponding author), Swiggy, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",shaik.masihullah1@swiggy.in; meghana.negi@swiggy.in; jose.matthew@swiggy.in; jairaj.s@swiggy.in,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-14463-9; 978-3-031-14462-2,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2022,13480.0,,,,,,150.0,167.0,,10.1007/978-3-031-14463-9_10,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BU0TL,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000871733700010,0,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence"

However, many real-world networks are characterized by uncertainty, leading to the notion of uncertain or probabilistic graphs. The transition from deterministic graphs to uncertain graphs introduces new challenges. We present USIWO, an efficient and practical solution for community search in unweighted uncertain graphs with edge uncertainty. In addition to being accurate, the approach utilizes an efficient data structure for storing only the relevant parts of the network in main memory, eliminating the need to store the entire graph, making it a valuable tool in finding the core of a community on very large uncertain graphs, when there is limited time and memory available. The algorithm operates through a one-node-expansion approach, based on the concepts of strong and weak links within a graph.

We extract, process and analyze mid-infrared spectra of local (z < 0.4) ULIRGs and quasars between 5-38 mu m through internally developed Python routines, in order to generate similarity graphs, with the nodes representing ULIRGs being grouped together based on the similarity of their spectra. Additionally, we extract and compare physical features from the mid-IR spectra, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission and silicate depth absorption features, as indicators of the presence of star-forming regions and obscuring dust, in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of each evolutionary stage of ULIRGs. Our analysis identifies five groups of local ULIRGs based on their mid-IR spectra, which is quite consistent with the well established fork classification diagram by providing a higher level classification. We demonstrate how graph clustering algorithms and network analysis tools can be utilized as unsupervised learning techniques for revealing direct or indirect relations between various galaxy properties and evolutionary stages, which provides an alternative methodology to previous works for classification in galaxy evolution.

In this method, we first obtain the multi-order similarity of the network using graph convolution (GC). Then, we aggregate the multi-order similarity to characterize the network structure and use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to achieve low-dimensional node characterization. Finally, we predict the number of modules based on the bayesian information criterion (BIC) and use the gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify modules. To testify to the efficacy of MultiSimeNc in module identification, we apply this method to two types of biological networks and six benchmark networks, where the biological networks are constructed based on the fusion of multi-omics data from glioblastoma (GBM). The analysis shows that MultiSimNeNc outperforms several state-of-the-art module identification algorithms in identification accuracy, which is an effective method for understanding biomolecular mechanisms of pathogenesis from a module-level perspective.","[Wu, Hao; Liang, Biting; Zhang, Hongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhongli] Peoples Govt Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Shandong University,"Wu, H; Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",haowu@sdu.edu.cn; zhm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Zhang, Hongming/ABF-8690-2021; Li, zhuangzhuang/JAD-1371-2023; Wu, Hao/AGE-4639-2022","Wu, Hao/0000-0003-2340-9258","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972322, 62272278]; Natural Key Research and Development Program, China [2021YFF0704103]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Key Research and Development Program, China; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","Funding The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61972322 & 62272278) , and by the Natural Key Research and Development Program, China (Grant No. 2021YFF0704103) , and by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China.

Moreover, their results tend to exhibit significant volatility. These issues might be solved by a proper initialization of such algorithms with some carefully chosen partition of nodes. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such initialization applied to the two most commonly used community detection algorithms: Louvain and Leiden. We use a partition obtained by embedding the nodes of the graph into some high dimensional space of real numbers and then running a clustering algorithm on this latent representation. We show that this procedure significantly improves the results. Proper embedding filters unnecessary information while retaining the proximity of nodes belonging to the same community. As a result, clustering algorithms ran on these embeddings merge nodes only when they are similar with a high degree of certainty, resulting in a stable and effective initial partition.","[Pankratz, Bartosz; Pralat, Pawel] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pankratz, Bartosz; Kaminski, Bogumil] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland",Toronto Metropolitan University; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pankratz, B (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Pankratz, B (corresponding author), SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland.",bartosz.pankratz@ryerson.ca; bkamins@sgh.waw.pl; pralat@ryerson.ca,"Kamiński, Bogumił/AAF-5417-2020; Pankratz, Bartosz/JFA-6346-2023","Pankratz, Bartosz/0000-0001-7618-9119",,,,,34,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-031-21133-1; 978-3-031-21131-7; 978-3-031-21130-0,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2023,1078.0,,,,,,221.0,232,,10.1007/978-3-031-21131-7_17,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BU9UI,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000963499200017,0,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications"

COPD represents one of many areas of research where identifying complex pathways and networks of interacting biomarkers is an important avenue toward studying disease progression and potentially discovering cures. Recently, sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) was developed to identify complex relationships between omics associated with a disease phenotype, such as lung function. SmCCNet uses two sets of omics datasets and an associated output phenotypes to generate a multi-omics graph, which can then be used to explore relationships between omics in the context of a disease. Detecting significant subgraphs within this multi-omics network, i.e., subgraphs which exhibit high correlation to a disease phenotype and high inter-connectivity, can help clinicians identify complex biological relationships involved in disease progression. The current approach to identifying significant subgraphs relies on hierarchical clustering, which can be used to inform clinicians about important pathways involved in the disease or phenotype of interest. The reliance on a hierarchical clustering approach can hinder subgraph quality by biasing toward finding more compact subgraphs and removing larger significant subgraphs. This study aims to introduce new significant subgraph detection techniques. In particular, we introduce two subgraph detection methods, dubbed Correlated PageRank and Correlated Louvain, by extending the Personalized PageRank Clustering and Louvain algorithms, as well as a hybrid approach combining the two proposed methods, and compare them to the hierarchical method currently in use. The proposed methods show significant improvement in the quality of the subgraphs produced when compared to the current state of the art.","[Abdel-Hafiz, Mohamed; Helmi, Shahab; Banaei-Kashani, Farnoush] Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Management & Min Lab, Denver, CO 80204 USA; [Najafi, Mesbah] Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Math, Denver, CO USA; [Pratte, Katherine A.; Bowler, Russell P.] Natl Jewish Hlth, Denver, CO USA; [Zhuang, Yonghua; Liu, Weixuan; Kechris, Katerina J.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Informat, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA; [Bowler, Russell P.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA; [Lange, Leslie] Univ Colorado, Dept Med, Div Biomed Informat & Personalized Med, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO USA",Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; National Jewish Health; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Colorado School of Public Health; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Abdel-Hafiz, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Denver, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Management & Min Lab, Denver, CO 80204 USA.",mohamed.abdel-hafiz@cuanschutz.edu,"Zhuang, Yonghua/A-2946-2013","Zhuang, Yonghua/0000-0002-1822-2395; Kechris, Katerina/0000-0002-3725-5459","National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01 HL152735, R01 HL137995, U01 HL089897, U01 HL089856]; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [R01HL137995] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) R01 HL152735 and R01 HL137995.

The quantitative method to detect delayed recognition is described as the pair of Sleeping Beauty (SB) and its Prince (PR), where SB refers to citation bursts and its PR triggers SB's awakeness calculated based on their citation history. This research provides the methods to extract valid and large SB-PR pairs from a comprehensive Scopus dataset and analyses how PR discovers SB. We prove that the proposed method can extract long-sleep and large-scale SB and its PR best covers the previous multi-disciplinary pairs, which enables to observe delayed recognition. Besides, we show that the high-impact SB-PR pairs extracted by the proposed method are more likely to be located in the same field. This indicates that a hidden SB that your research can awaken may exist closer than you think. On the other hand, although SB-PR pairs are fat-tailed in Beauty Coefficient and more likely to integrate separate fields compared to ordinary citations, it is not possible to predict which citation leads to awake SB using the rarity of citation. There is no easy way to limit the areas where SB-PR pairs occur or detect it early, suggesting that researchers and administrators need to focus on a variety of areas. This research provides comprehensive knowledge about the development of scientific findings that will be evaluated over time.","[Miura, Takahiro; Asatani, Kimitaka; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Fac Engn Bldg 3, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Miura, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Fac Engn Bldg 3, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",miura@ipr-ctr.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Miura, Takahiro/GWC-3765-2022; Ichiro, Sakata/GWM-7823-2022","Asatani, Kimitaka/0000-0003-3595-8940; Miura, Takahiro/0000-0002-3409-3044; SAKATA, ICHIRO/0000-0001-5881-3790",,,,,57,5,5,0,23,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2364-8228,,APPL NETW SCI,Appl.

Thanks to advances in online learning systems, however, student data can be automatically collected and used for the investigation and prediction of the students' learning performance. In this article, we present a novel approach to analyse students' learning behaviour, as well as the relationship between these behaviours and learning assessment results, in the context of programming education. A bespoke method has been built based on a combination of Random Matrix Theory, a Community Detection algorithm and statistical hypothesis tests. The datasets contain fine-grained information about students' learning behaviours in two programming courses over two academic years with about 400 first-year students in a Medium-sized Metropolitan University in Dublin. The proposed method is a noval approach to data preprocessing which can improve the analysis and prediction based on learning behavioural datasets. The proposed approach deals with the issues of noise and trend effect in the data and has shown its success in detecting groups of students who have similar learning behaviours and outcomes. The higher performing groups have been found to be more active in practical-related activities throughout the course. Conversely, we found that the lower performing groups engage more with lecture notes instead of doing programming tasks. The learning behaviours data can also be used to predict students' outcomes (i.e. Pass or Fail the terminal exams) at the early stages of the study, using popular machine learning classification techniques.

The problem appears when dealing with graphs that are created over time, such as online social networks where new users appear continuously, or protein interaction networks when new proteins are discovered. For very large graphs, it is computationally too expensive to repeatedly apply standard clustering algorithms. Instead, algorithms whose time complexity only depends on the size of the incoming subset of edges in every step are needed. At the same time, such algorithms should find clusterings whose quality is close to that produced by offline algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the computational model and present an incremental clustering algorithm. We test the algorithm performance and quality on a wide variety of instances.

Therefore, determining comorbid diseases would significantly affect the treatment of cancer patients. Because cancer disease is very complex, we can represent the relationship between cancer and its comorbidities as a network. Furthermore, the network analysis can be employed to determine comorbidities as a community detection problem because the relationship between cancer and its comorbidities forms a community. This study investigates which community detection algorithms are more appropriate to determine the comorbid of cancer. Given different community findings, this study attempted to analyze the modularity generated by the algorithm to decide the significant comorbid diseases. We retrieved lung cancer comorbid data on the basis of text mining manuscripts in PubMed, searched through disease ontologies, and calculated disease similarity. We investigate 20 algorithms using five modularity metrics and 16 fitness function evaluations to determine the significant comorbid diseases. The results show the five best modularity algorithms, namely label propagation, spinglass, Chinese whispers, Louvain, RB Pots. These five algorithms found significant comorbidities: blood vessels, immune system, bone, pancreas, and metabolic disorders, atrial cardiac septal defect, atrial fibrillation respiratory system, interstitial lung, and diabetes mellitus. The fitness function justifies the results of the community algorithm, and the ones that have a significant effect are average internal degree, size, and edges inside.

This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.","[Nembrini, Riccardo; Carugno, Costantino; Dacrema, Maurizio Ferrari; Cremonesi, Paolo] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Nembrini, Riccardo; Carugno, Costantino] ContentWise, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Nembrini, R (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.;Nembrini, R (corresponding author), ContentWise, Milan, Italy.",riccardo.nembrini@polimi.it; costantino.carugno@polimi.it; maurizio.ferrari@polimi.it; paolo.cremonesi@polimi.it,"Dacrema, Maurizio/ABE-9283-2021","Ferrari Dacrema, Maurizio/0000-0001-7103-2788",,,,,43,9,9,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9278-5,,,,2022,,,,,,,579.0,585,,10.1145/3523227.3551478,0.0,,,7,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW3KR,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:001139226600080,0,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods"

There are many available methods to perform pathway analysis, many of them rely on an upstream differential expression analysis, and many model the relations between the abundances of the analytes in a pathway as linear relationships.Results Here, we propose a new method for pathway analysis, MIPath, that relies on information theoretical principles and, therefore, does not model the association between pathway activity and phenotype, resulting in relatively few assumptions. For this, we construct a graph of the data points for each pathway using a nearest-neighbor approach and score the association between the structure of this graph and the phenotype of these same samples using Mutual Information while adjusting for the effects of random chance in each score. The initial nearest neighbor approach evades individual gene-level comparisons, hence making the method scalable and less vulnerable to missing values.

Traditionally, epistasis has been modeled using the Cartesian epistatic model, a multiplicative approach based on standard statistical regression. However, a recent study investigating epistasis in obesity-related traits has identified potential limitations of the Cartesian epistatic model, revealing that it likely only detects a fraction of the genetic interactions occurring in natural systems. In contrast, the exclusive-or (XOR) epistatic model has shown promise in detecting a broader range of epistatic interactions and revealing more biologically relevant functions associated with interacting variants. To investigate whether the XOR epistatic model also forms distinct network structures compared to the Cartesian model, we applied network science to examine genetic interactions underlying body mass index (BMI) in rats (Rattus norvegicus).ResultsOur comparative analysis of XOR and Cartesian epistatic models in rats reveals distinct topological characteristics. The XOR model exhibits enhanced sensitivity to epistatic interactions between the network communities found in the Cartesian epistatic network, facilitating the identification of novel trait-related biological functions via community-based enrichment analysis. Additionally, the XOR network features triangle network motifs, indicative of higher-order epistatic interactions. This research also evaluates the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based edge pruning on network-based epistasis analysis, finding that LD-based edge pruning may lead to increased network fragmentation, which may hinder the effectiveness of network analysis for the investigation of epistasis. We confirmed through network permutation analysis that most XOR and Cartesian epistatic networks derived from the data display distinct structural properties compared to randomly shuffled networks.ConclusionsCollectively, these findings highlight the XOR model's ability to uncover meaningful biological associations and higher-order epistasis derived from lower-order network topologies. The introduction of community-based enrichment analysis and motif-based epistatic discovery emphasize network science as a critical approach for advancing epistasis research and understanding complex genetic architectures.","[Sha, Zhendong; Hu, Ting] Queens Univ, Sch Comp, 557 Goodwin Hall,21-25 Union St, Kingston, ON K7L 2N8, Canada; [Freda, Philip J.; Bhandary, Priyanka; Ghosh, Attri; Matsumoto, Nicholas; Moore, Jason H.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Pacific Design Ctr, Dept Computat Biomed, 700 N San Vicente Blvd,Suite G540, West Hollywood, CA 90069 USA",Queens University - Canada; Cedars Sinai Medical Center,"Hu, T (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Comp, 557 Goodwin Hall,21-25 Union St, Kingston, ON K7L 2N8, Canada.;Moore, JH (corresponding author), Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Pacific Design Ctr, Dept Computat Biomed, 700 N San Vicente Blvd,Suite G540, West Hollywood, CA 90069 USA.",jason.moore@csmc.edu; ting.hu@queensu.ca,"SHA, Zhendong/E-9463-2012",,National Institutes of Health,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"We would like to thank Apurva S.

Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the classification of cells into distinct types. Many approaches build on existing clustering literature to develop tools specific to single-cell. However, almost all of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters to control the number of clusters. This affects both the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as well as their replicability across datasets. While many recommendations exist, in general, there is little assurance that any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in the trade-off between cluster resolution and replicability. For instance, another set of parameters may result in more clusters that are also more replicable.Results Here, we propose Dune, a new method for optimizing the trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their replicability. Our method takes as input a set of clustering results-or partitions-on a single dataset and iteratively merges clusters within each partitions in order to maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on multiple datasets from different platforms, Dune outperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of replicability of the resultant merged clusters as well as concordance with ground truth. Dune is available as an R package on Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Dune.html.Conclusions Cluster refinement by Dune helps improve the robustness of any clustering analysis and reduces the reliance on tuning parameters. This method provides an objective approach for borrowing information across multiple clusterings to generate replicable clusters most likely to represent common biological features across multiple datasets.","[Van den Berge, Koen; Purdom, Elizabeth; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Street, Kelly] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Populat & Publ Hlth Sci, Div Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Fischer, Stephan; Gillis, Jesse] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY USA; [Van den Berge, Koen] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium; [Chance, Rebecca; Ngai, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA USA; [Risso, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Padua, Italy; [de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Purdom, Elizabeth; Dudoit, Sandrine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Computat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Southern California; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Ghent University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Padua; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Dudoit, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Computat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sandrine@berkeley.edu,"Street, Kelly/L-1147-2019",,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO),We thank Quentin Dumont and Frank Herbert [35] for inspiration for the Dune name.,,40,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,MAY 24,2024,25.0,1,,,,,,,198,10.1186/s12859-024-05814-6,0.0,,,19,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,SD4U4,38789920.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:001232515000001,0,Mathematical & Computational Biology

There are many available methods to perform pathway analysis, many of them rely on an upstream differential expression analysis, and many model the relations between the abundances of the analytes in a pathway as linear relationships.Results Here, we propose a new method for pathway analysis, MIPath, that relies on information theoretical principles and, therefore, does not model the association between pathway activity and phenotype, resulting in relatively few assumptions. For this, we construct a graph of the data points for each pathway using a nearest-neighbor approach and score the association between the structure of this graph and the phenotype of these same samples using Mutual Information while adjusting for the effects of random chance in each score. The initial nearest neighbor approach evades individual gene-level comparisons, hence making the method scalable and less vulnerable to missing values.

JSNMF enables data visualization and clustering of the cells and also facilitates downstream analysis, including the characterization of markers and functional pathway enrichment analysis. The core of JSNMF is an unsupervised method based on JSNMF, where it assumes different latent variables for the two molecular modalities, and integrates the information of transcriptomic and epigenomic data with consensus graph fusion, which better tackles the distinct characteristics and levels of noise across different molecular modalities in single-cell multiomics data. We applied JSNMF to single-cell multiomics datasets from different tissues and different technologies. The results demonstrate the superior performance of JSNMF in clustering and data visualization of the cells. JSNMF also allows joint analysis of multiple single-cell multiomics experiments and single-cell multiomics data with more than two modalities profiled on the same cell.

However, existing spatial clustering methods often fail to exploit the full potential of spatial information, resulting in inaccurate identification of spatial domains.Results In this article, we develop a deep graph contrastive clustering framework, stDGCC, that accurately uncovers underlying spatial domains via explicitly modeling spatial information and gene expression profiles from spatial transcriptomics data. The stDGCC framework proposes a spatially informed graph node embedding model to preserve the topological information of spots and to learn the informative and discriminative characterization of spatial transcriptomics data through self-supervised contrastive learning. By simultaneously optimizing the contrastive learning loss, reconstruction loss, and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, stDGCC achieves joint optimization of feature learning and topology structure preservation in an end-to-end manner. We validate the effectiveness of stDGCC on various spatial transcriptomics datasets acquired from different platforms, each with varying spatial resolutions.

While current approaches are successful in reducing the number of sequence alignments performed, the generated clusters are based on a single sequence identity threshold applied to every cluster. Poor choices of this identity threshold would thus lead to low quality clusters. There is however little support provided to users in selecting thresholds that are well matched with the input sequences. Results We present a novel sequence clustering approach called ALFATClust that exploits rapid pairwise alignment-free sequence distance calculations and community detection in graph for clusters generation. Instead of a single threshold applied to every generated cluster, ALFATClust is capable of dynamically determining the cut-off threshold for each individual cluster by considering both cluster separation and intra-cluster sequence similarity. Benchmarking analysis shows that ALFATClust generally outperforms existing approaches by simultaneously maintaining cluster robustness and substantial cluster separation for the benchmark datasets. The software also provides an evaluation report for verifying the quality of the non-singleton clusters obtained. Conclusions ALFATClust is able to generate sequence clusters having high intra-cluster sequence similarity and substantial separation between clusters without having users to decide precise similarity cut-off thresholds.","[Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore; [Chiu, Jimmy Ka Ho; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117549, Singapore.;Ong, RTH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",ephoth@nus.edu.sg,,,"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore [SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04]","Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","This research is supported by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore under its Infectious Disease Programme Research (SSHSPH ID-PRG/PILOTGRANT/2018/04).",,43,5,6,2,21,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,MAR 30,2022,23.0,1,,,,,,,108,10.1186/s12859-022-04643-9,0.0,,,20,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,0D5HH,35354426.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000776025700002,0,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

Employing Mugen-UMAP, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 365 single-cell samples across 12 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, revealing distinct clusters associated with histological subtypes of NSCLC. Moreover, to demonstrate the general utility of Mugen-UMAP, we applied the program to 9 additional single-cell WES datasets from various cancer types, uncovering interesting patterns of cell clusters that warrant further investigation. In summary, Mugen-UMAP provides a quick and effective visualization method to uncover cell cluster patterns based on the gene mutation information from single-cell DNA sequencing data.ConclusionsThe application of Mugen-UMAP demonstrates its capacity to provide valuable insights into the visualization and interpretation of single-cell DNA sequencing data.

There are many existing methods enabling us to evaluate the criticality ranking of links in networks, which are based on straightforward algorithms and topological features of analyzed graphs. In this paper, we offer another perspective on the problem and propose a novel approach, to be called the Evolutionary Approach (EA), that is based on a genetic-like algorithm and turns directly to an integral criterion of decomposition efficiency instead of network topology. Like all the genetic algorithms, EA is grounded on the iterative enhancement of randomly generated solutions via reproduction, cross-over, and mutation processes. The EA-efficiency is illustrated via decomposing three real-world benchmark networks by using the proposed method, the acknowledged Link Entropy (LE) method, and the most recent Improved Link Entropy (ILE) method. The comparison of the obtained results demonstrates that the EA-efficiency exceeds the ILE-efficiency for 5.7%-28.1% depending on the network complexity, with respect to the LE-efficiency the increase is approximately two-fold. Besides, the temporal aspects of ordering the network edges according to their significance using solely EA or in its combination with LE and ILE are discussed.","[Lubashevskiy, Vasily] Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, Kawagoe 3501197, Japan; [Lubashevsky, Ihor] HSE Tikhonov Moscow Inst Elect & Math, Moscow 123458, Russia",Tokyo International University,"Lubashevskiy, V (corresponding author), Tokyo Int Univ, Inst Int Strategy, Kawagoe 3501197, Japan.",vubashe@tiu.ac.jp,"Lubashevsky, Ihor/ABB-5637-2021; Lubashevskiy, Vasily/JTU-7139-2023","Lubashevskiy, Vasily/0000-0002-2399-5050",,,,,62,0,0,2,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11.0,,,,,,58046.0,58054.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3284906,0.0,,,9,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,K0QQ1,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001013584000001,0,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic"

Recent advancements in 3D vertical interconnection technology have enabled 3D interconnections with reduced area overhead, potentially enhancing 3D IC performance in terms of timing, power, yield, and cost. However, despite the increased inter-die connection capacity enabled by fine-pitch 3D vias, research on 3D IC partitioning methods for timing improvement remains insufficient. This paper proposes a partitioning and placement method that optimizes the timing of 3D ICs by leveraging the increased inter-die connection capacity provided by fine pitch 3D vias. By using the Leiden algorithm and unsupervised GNN, we achieve optimal partitioning without relying on the results of 2D placement or additional training data. Our method employs balanced COP-KMeans to incorporate critical path optimization into partitioning, while ensuring balanced cell allocation across dies, thereby maximizing the area benefits of 3D ICs. Additionally, we optimize the timing of 3D ICs through 3D cell placement with critical net weight adjustments and a novel 3D via placement approach that differs from traditional 3D Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL) optimization perspectives.","[Kim, Donggyu; Hur, Junseok; Lee, Jakang; Cho, Jinoh; Kang, Seokhyeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Kim, Minjae] Baum Design Syst Co, Seoul, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kim, D (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",gyu511@postech.ac.kr,,"LEE, JAKANG/0009-0004-0010-9863; Kang, Seokhyeong/0000-0003-3015-1806","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [RS-2023-00222085, RS-2023-00222609]","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. RS-2023-00222085, Development of memory module and memory compiler for non-volatile PIM and No. RS-2023-00222609, Development of thermal modelling and heat-spreading architecture for heterogeneous integrating package of AI chiplets).",,27,1,1,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0699-8,,,,2024,,,,,,,,,19,10.1145/3670474.3685957,0.0,,,7,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BX7NJ,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001323675100019,0,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic"

Various global and local techniques exist for uncovering community structures in social networks wherein diffusion-based algorithms are proposed as novel methods for local community detection, particularly suited for large-scale networks. The efficacy of diffusion processes and initial detection is paramount in the successful identification of community structures within social networks. This effectiveness hinges significantly on the meticulous selection of the label diffuser core, which serves as the foundation for propagating labels through the network, and the precise labeling of boundary nodes. Addressing the constraints of current community detection algorithms, notably their time complexity and efficiency, this paper proposes a novel local community detection algorithm that combines core expansion with label diffusion, and deep embedding techniques. In the proposed method, a new centrality measure is introduced for appropriate core selection to facilitate precise label diffusion in the initial phase. Subsequently, a deep embedding technique is employed for updating labels of boundary and core nodes using the GraphSage embedding method. Finally, a rapid merging step is executed to amalgamate initially proximate communities into finalized community structures in large-scale social networks. We evaluate our algorithm on 14 real-world and 4 synthetic networks and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of NMI, F-measure, ARI, and modularity. According to numerical results, the proposed method shows approximately 1.04 %, 1.03 %, and 1.12 % improvement in F-measure, NMI, and ARI measures respectively, compared to the second-best method, LBLD, in the networks with ground-truth. In addition, our method is able to accurately identify communities in large-scale networks such as Orkut, YouTube, and LiveJournal, where it ranks among the top-performing methods. Our approach exhibits the best performance in terms of ARI compared to other algorithms under comparison.","[Bouyer, Asgarali; Shahgholi, Pouya] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Comp Engn, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Bouyer, Asgarali; Arasteh, Bahman] Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Arasteh, Bahman] Khazar Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Istinye Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee] Western Caspian Univ, Dept Mech & Math, Baku, Azerbaijan",Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University; Istinye University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Khazar University; Istinye University; Yuan Ze University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Western Caspian University,"Tirkolaee, EB (corresponding author), Istinye Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkiye.",erfansjs@gmail.com,"Arasteh, Bahman/AAN-9555-2021; Tirkolaee, Erfan/U-3676-2017",,,,,,73,0,0,6,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0045-7906,1879-0755,,COMPUT ELECTR ENG,Comput.

Community detection aims to extract these community structures from networks. Many community detection methods have been proposed that consider the problem from different perspectives. However, with the emergence of very large and complex networks from variety of domains, there has been a growing need for community detection methods that can operate at scale effectively and efficiently. Considering this, we propose a novel algorithm for large-scale community detection, based on two novel similarity indices we propose as well. In the first stage of our proposed algorithm, we generate candidate communities using a mechanism similar to information propagation very rapidly. Then, we merge small candidates that have fewer nodes than a calculated threshold with the larger ones using similarity between nodes and communities. Next, we engage a refinement operation on the candidates by moving all nodes to the candidates to which they are most similar using the same similarity index again. After that, we merge small communities with larger ones by using the similarity between communities until no gain in the modularity is obtained. Finally, in the last stage, we employ the same refinement operation as in the third stage. With an extensive experimentation on real-world and artificially-generated benchmark networks, we demonstrate and verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm scales very well with growing size and complexity of networks. Besides, our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art community detection methods both in detection performance and computation time.","[Tunali, Volkan] Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey",Maltepe University,"Tunali, V (corresponding author), Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey.",volkan.tunali@gmail.com,"Tunali, Volkan/T-6717-2018","Tunali, Volkan/0000-0002-2735-7996",,,,,38,5,5,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9.0,,,,,,78538.0,78552,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083971,0.0,,,15,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TJ9NL,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000673798800001,0,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic"

LISA2 visualizes complex trajectories using 3D Landmark ISOmetric feature MAPping (L-ISOMAP). We apply LISA2 to simulation and real datasets in cerebellum, diencephalon, and hematopoietic stem cells including both single-cell transcriptomics data and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin data.

We present Building Aggregates with a Neighborhood Kernel and Spatial Yardstick (BANKSY), an algorithm that unifies these two spatial clustering problems by embedding cells in a product space of their own and the local neighborhood transcriptome, representing cell state and microenvironment, respectively. BANKSY's spatial feature augmentation strategy improved performance on both tasks when tested on diverse RNA (imaging, sequencing) and protein (imaging) datasets. BANKSY revealed unexpected niche-dependent cell states in the mouse brain and outperformed competing methods on domain segmentation and cell typing benchmarks. BANKSY can also be used for quality control of spatial transcriptomics data and for spatially aware batch effect correction. Importantly, it is substantially faster and more scalable than existing methods, enabling the processing of millions of cell datasets. In summary, BANKSY provides an accurate, biologically motivated, scalable and versatile framework for analyzing spatially resolved omics data. BANKSY is an algorithm with R and Python implementations that identifies both cell types and tissue domains from spatially resolved omics data by incorporating spatial kernels capturing microenvironmental information.

Many clustering methods have been proposed to discover heterogenous cell types from scRNA-seq data. However, adaptive clustering with accurate cluster number reflecting intrinsic biology nature from large-scale scRNA-seq data remains quite challenging.Results Here, we propose a single-cell Deep Adaptive Clustering (scDAC) model by coupling the Autoencoder (AE) and the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). By jointly optimizing the model parameters of AE and DPMM, scDAC achieves adaptive clustering with accurate cluster numbers on scRNA-seq data. We verify the performance of scDAC on five subsampled datasets with different numbers of cell types and compare it with 15 widely used clustering methods across nine scRNA-seq datasets. Our results demonstrate that scDAC can adaptively find accurate numbers of cell types or subtypes and outperforms other methods. Moreover, the performance of scDAC is robust to hyperparameter changes.Availability and implementation The scDAC is implemented in Python.

There are many available methods to perform pathway analysis, many of them rely on an upstream differential expression analysis, and many model the relations between the abundances of the analytes in a pathway as linear relationships.Results Here, we propose a new method for pathway analysis, MIPath, that relies on information theoretical principles and, therefore, does not model the association between pathway activity and phenotype, resulting in relatively few assumptions. For this, we construct a graph of the data points for each pathway using a nearest-neighbor approach and score the association between the structure of this graph and the phenotype of these same samples using Mutual Information while adjusting for the effects of random chance in each score. The initial nearest neighbor approach evades individual gene-level comparisons, hence making the method scalable and less vulnerable to missing values.

An essential step in scRNA-seq data analysis is the annotation of cell types. Traditional cell-type annotation is mainly clustering the cells first, and then using the aggregated cluster-level expression profiles and the marker genes to label each cluster. Such methods are greatly dependent on the clustering results, which are insufficient for accurate annotation. Results: In this article, we propose a semi-supervised learning method for cell-type annotation called CALLR. It combines unsupervised learning represented by the graph Laplacian matrix constructed from all the cells and supervised learning using sparse logistic regression. By alternately updating the cell clusters and annotation labels, high annotation accuracy can be achieved. The model is formulated as an optimization problem, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve it. Experiments on 10 real datasets show that CALLR outperforms the compared (semi-)supervised learning methods, and the popular clustering methods.","[Wei, Ziyang] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wei, Ziyang; Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Lab Math Nonlinear Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuqin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Contemporary Appl Math, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Chicago; Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Lab Math Nonlinear Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Contemporary Appl Math, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhangs@fudan.edu.cn,,"ZHANG, SHUQIN/0000-0001-8223-844X",Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [20ZR1407700]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [61932008],Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported, in part, by Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [No. 20ZR1407700] and Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [No. 61932008].",,53,15,15,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1367-4803,1460-2059,,BIOINFORMATICS,Bioinformatics,JUL,2021,37.0,,,1.0,,,I51,I58,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btab286,0.0,,,8,Statistics & Probability,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,US8VF,34252936.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000697703700008,0,Statistics & Probability

In recent years, the discovery and characterization of protein complexes have substantially progressed through advances in cryo-electron microscopy, proteomics, and computational structure prediction. This development results in a strong need for computational approaches to analyse the data of large protein complexes for structural and functional characterization. Here, we aim to provide a suitable approach, which processes the growing number of large protein complexes, to obtain biologically meaningful information on the hierarchical organization of the structures of protein complexes.Results We modelled the quaternary structure of protein complexes as undirected, labelled graphs called complex graphs. In complex graphs, the vertices represent protein chains and the edges spatial chain-chain contacts. We hypothesized that clusters based on the complex graph correspond to functional biological modules. To compute the clusters, we applied the Leiden clustering algorithm. To evaluate our approach, we chose the human respiratory complex I, which has been extensively investigated and exhibits a known biological module structure experimentally validated. Additionally, we characterized a eukaryotic group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the head of the bacteriophage phi 29.

This issue has only been studied from an edge-centric standpoint. This article introduces n Dec, a node-centric community deception approach that can directly influence where C's members are placed. Indeed, nDec considers how nodes can be moved between communities and analyzes the most profitable C's node removals and additions. nDec is built around a node-centric view optimization function based on modularity, a well-known cluster quality metric. We discovered that rather than blindly minimizing modularityas edge-centric approaches do, it is possible to devise a strategy appealing to detection algorithms while improving the level of concealment of C.

This topic has attracted researchers from both academia and industry. Among different community detection methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) have become popular. Considering the drawbacks of the currently used locus-based and solution-vector-based encodings to represent the individuals, in this article, we propose (1) a new node similarity-based encoding method, MST-based encoding, to represent a network partition as an individual, which can avoid the shortcomings of the previous encoding schemes. Then, we propose (2) a new adaptive genetic algorithm for the purpose of detecting communities in networks, along with (3) a new initial population generation function to improve the convergence time of the algorithm, and (4) a new sine-based adaptive mutation function which adjusts the mutations according to the improvement in the fitness value of the best individual in the population pool. The proposed method combines the similarity-based and modularity-optimization-based approaches to find communities in complex networks in an evolutionary framework. Besides the fact that the proposed encoding can avoid meaningless mutations or disconnected communities, we show that the new initial population generation function and the new adaptive mutation function can improve the convergence time of the algorithm. Several experiments and comparisons were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using modularity and NMI measures on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results show that the proposed method can find the communities in a significantly shorter time than other GAs while reaching a better trade-off in the different measures.","[Hesamipour, Sajjad; Balafar, Mohammad Ali; Mousazadeh, Saeed] Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran",University of Tabriz,"Hesamipour, S (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",sajjadhesami@yahoo.com; balafarila@tabrizu.ac.ir; s.mousazadeh95@tabrizu.ac.ir,"; Balafar, Prof M.A/D-1865-2010","Hesamipour, Sajjad/0000-0003-4886-8995; Balafar, Prof M.A/0000-0001-5898-0871",,,,,68,0,0,0,4,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,FEB 28,2023,2023.0,,,,,,,,4796536,10.1155/2023/4796536,0.0,,,22,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,9T7XE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000947235900001,0,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications"

Extensive research has been conducted on detecting partiality patterns in the academic community. However, in the last few decades, limited research has focused on assessing gender and nationality biases in graduate admission results of universities. In this study, we collected a novel and comprehensive dataset containing information on approximately 14,000 graduate students majoring in computer science (CS) at the top 25 North American universities. We used statistical hypothesis tests to determine whether there is a preference for students' gender and nationality in the admission processes. In addition to partiality patterns, we discuss the relationship between gender/nationality diversity and the scientific achievements of research teams. Consistent with previous studies, our findings show that there is no gender bias in the admission of graduate students to research groups, but we observed bias based on students' nationality.","[Kalhor, Ghazal; Zeraati, Tanin] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Bahrak, Behnam] Tehran Inst Adv Studies, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Kalhor, G (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran.",kalhor.ghazal@ut.ac.ir,"Kalhor, Ghazal/JPA-2347-2023","Kalhor, Ghazal/0000-0002-6153-9048",Thanks to Baharan Khatami for providing some helpful ideas for this research.,Thanks to Baharan Khatami for providing some helpful ideas for this research.,Thanks to Baharan Khatami for providing some helpful ideas for this research.,,39,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2193-1127,,EPJ DATA SCI,EPJ Data Sci.,OCT 4,2023,12.0,1,,,,,,,44,10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00422-5,0.0,,,23,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,T6TG7,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001079284100002,0,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications"

In particular, the scalability of graph analysis is a critical hurdle impeding progress in large-scale downstream inference. To address this challenge, we introduce a temporal encoder embedding method. This approach leverages ground-truth or estimated vertex labels, enabling an efficient embedding of large-scale graph data and the processing of billions of edges within minutes. Furthermore, this embedding unveils a temporal dynamic statistic capable of detecting communication pattern shifts across all levels, ranging from individual vertices to vertex communities and the overall graph structure. We provide theoretical support to confirm its soundness under random graph models, and demonstrate its numerical advantages in capturing evolving communities and identifying outliers. Finally, we showcase the practical application of our approach by analyzing an anonymized time-series communication network from a large organization spanning 2019-2020, enabling us to assess the impact of Covid-19 on workplace communication patterns.","[Shen, Cencheng] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Larson, Jonathan; Trinh, Ha] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Qin, Xihan] Univ Delaware, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Park, Youngser] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat AMS, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Park, Youngser] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Imaging Sci CIS, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Park, Youngser; Priebe, Carey E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Math Inst Data Sci MINDS, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Delaware; Microsoft; University of Delaware; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University,"Shen, CC (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",shenc@udel.edu; jolarso@microsoft.com; trinhha@microsoft.com; xihan@udel.edu; youngser@jhu.edu; cep@jhu.edu,"Shen, Cencheng/AAB-8052-2020; Qin, Xihan/LMN-4203-2024","Larson, Jonathan/0000-0002-8865-9306; Qin, Xihan/0000-0003-1096-5941; Park, Youngser/0000-0002-3978-5533",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),No Statement Available,,45,3,3,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",2327-4697,,,IEEE T NETW SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

The consistency and quality of performance between the results under a hyperparameter optimisation with the default hyperparameters is evaluated.

A comparison of metrics indicates that ties in ranks can substantially alter the quantification of randomness.

To connect dynamics and function in systems with these higher-order interactions, network scientists have generalised random-walk models to hypergraphs and studied the multibody effects on flow-based centrality measures. Mapping the large-scale structure of those flows requires effective community detection methods applied to cogent network representations. For different hypergraph data and research questions, which combination of random-walk model and network representation is best? We define unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows and explore how they and the underlying random-walk model change the number, size, depth, and overlap of identified multilevel communities. These results help researchers choose the appropriate modelling approach when mapping flows on hypergraphs. Real-world networks are typically characterised by a non-trivial organization at the mesoscale, such that groups of nodes are preferentially connected within distinguishable network regions known as communities. In this work the authors define unipartite, bipartite, and multilayer network representations of hypergraph flows to extract the community structure of social and biological systems with higher-order interactions.","[Eriksson, Anton; Edler, Daniel; Rojas, Alexis; Rosvall, Martin] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden; [de Domenico, Manlio] Fdn Bruno Kessler, CoMuNe Lab, Povo, TN, Italy",Umea University; Fondazione Bruno Kessler,"Eriksson, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Integrated Sci Lab, Umea, Sweden.",anton.eriksson@umu.se,"Rojas, Alexis/JFK-9462-2023; De Domenico, Manlio/B-5826-2014; Rosvall, Martin/ABD-6411-2020; Holmgren, Anton/GWZ-2857-2022; Edler, Daniel/AAE-7215-2020; Rosvall, Martin/A-9488-2015","Holmgren, Anton/0000-0001-5859-4073; Rojas, Alexis/0000-0002-1063-9102; Rosvall, Martin/0000-0002-7181-9940",Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research [SB16-0089]; Swedish Research Council [2018-05973]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) [SB16-0089] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF),Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"We thank Christopher Blocker, Leyden Fernandez, Viktor Jonsson, Michael Schaub, Jelena Smiljanic and Alexander Vergara for valuable comments that helped us improve the manuscript.

In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient time series segmentation method that combines the visibility graph method, particle swarm optimization, and community detection algorithm. We start by applying visibility graph theory to process time series data, resulting in a corresponding complex network. Next, we introduce an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with modularity Q as the objective function to optimize community detection. Finally, mapping the communities back to the nodes of the time series yields the segmented sequence. Our proposed method offers high segmentation accuracy and low time complexity (O(n(2))). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy on two different synthetic datasets.

Understanding the modal characteristics of taxis is vital to addressing many difficulties regarding urban sustainability. The movement trajectory of taxis reflects not only the operating features of taxis themselves but also urban structure and human mobility. In this work, the taxi trajectory data of Chengdu and New York City is processed, and the corresponding urban trip networks are constructed based on geographic information systems. We empirically and systematically analyze these urban trip networks according to the network hierarchy based on complex network theory. First, we studied the low-order organization of the urban trip networks (i.e., degree distribution, cluster-degree coefficient, rich-club coefficient, and so on.). We uncover the nontrivial relationship between network density and trip distance and find that the urban trip network in Chengdu is more heterogeneous than that in New York City. Second, we investigate the meso-order organization of the urban trip networks by using community detection. The community detection results show that the community boundaries are more or less mismatched with the administrative boundaries. Finally, we detect the higher-order organizations of the urban trip networks and find some critical nodes and regions. These empirical results from the perspective of complex networks provide insight to better understand the urban structure and human mobility, and potentially amend urban planning.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The detection process is usually complex and needs a lot of stages, which consumes time and effort. The limitation of the literature lies in providing methods that can be efficiently and easily adopted with minimum cost. This work proposes a novel approach for detecting counterfeit/forged documents. The proposed approach is based on network science approaches for analyzing documents' ink spectrums aiming to detect whether a document was counterfeited or forged. To this end, Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is used to retrieve the spectrums of the original and questioned documents. The extracted spectrums are formalized to create a dataset, which contains nodes (spectrums) and edges (correlations among spectrums). Then, the dataset is used to generate a network of spectrums that represented both the original and questioned documents. After that, the generated network is visualized and clustered. The detection process is mainly based on the information provided by network clusters (e.g., number of clusters). The results showed that the proposed approach was efficient in distinguishing documents. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to distinguish a document itself whether it was counterfeited by extracting the clusters of the questioned document.","[Amjed, Alaa; Mahmood, Basim] Univ Mosul, Dept Comp Sci, Mosul, Iraq; [AlMukhtar, Khalid A.

In this paper, we have proposed a three-step parallel algorithm, Par-Com, using the concept of k Clique and modularity optimization to address both of the above issues. The proposed algorithm increases the execution speed and also improves the quality of the community formed by optimizing modularity. Par-Com uses dynamic load balancing on the multicore architecture of Supercomputer ParamShivay. We have also evaluated Par-Com's performance against nine sequential and three parallel community detection algorithms on varying size datasets, i.e. karate, macaque, email, immuno, soc-epinions, facebook, and com-Friendster. The experiment result shows that Par-Com outperforms other algorithms under consideration with up to 45% increase in modularity and up to 84% increase in execution speed. Par-Com is also capable of detecting overlapping communities, fuzzy membership of each node, most influential node in each community formed, and outlier nodes. Nodes within a community that have the highest influence are deemed as experts. The choices made by an expert in a particular community are served as recommendations to other users within that community.","[Singh, Dipika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, India; [Garg, Rakhi] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, MMV, Varanasi, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, D (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, India.",dipikaa.ssingh@gmail.com; dipika.singh4@bhu.ac.in,,,University Grants Commission,"University Grants Commission(University Grants Commission, India)",This work was supported by University Grants Commission.,,41,0,0,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0256-4602,0974-5971,,IETE TECH REV,IETE Tech.

Community detection aims to extract these community structures from networks. Many community detection methods have been proposed that consider the problem from different perspectives. However, with the emergence of very large and complex networks from variety of domains, there has been a growing need for community detection methods that can operate at scale effectively and efficiently. Considering this, we propose a novel algorithm for large-scale community detection, based on two novel similarity indices we propose as well. In the first stage of our proposed algorithm, we generate candidate communities using a mechanism similar to information propagation very rapidly. Then, we merge small candidates that have fewer nodes than a calculated threshold with the larger ones using similarity between nodes and communities. Next, we engage a refinement operation on the candidates by moving all nodes to the candidates to which they are most similar using the same similarity index again. After that, we merge small communities with larger ones by using the similarity between communities until no gain in the modularity is obtained. Finally, in the last stage, we employ the same refinement operation as in the third stage. With an extensive experimentation on real-world and artificially-generated benchmark networks, we demonstrate and verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm scales very well with growing size and complexity of networks. Besides, our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art community detection methods both in detection performance and computation time.","[Tunali, Volkan] Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey",Maltepe University,"Tunali, V (corresponding author), Maltepe Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, TR-34857 Istanbul, Turkey.",volkan.tunali@gmail.com,"Tunali, Volkan/T-6717-2018","Tunali, Volkan/0000-0002-2735-7996",,,,,38,5,5,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9.0,,,,,,78538.0,78552,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083971,0.0,,,15,Telecommunications,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TJ9NL,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000673798800001,0,Telecommunications

Therefore, it is a fundamental component of decision-making mechanisms in many fields such as marketing, public health, criminology, etc. However, in this problem domain, it is an open challenge to capture all possible events with high accuracy, memory efficiency, and reasonable execution times under a single solution. To address this gap, we propose a novel method for tracking the evolution of communities (TREC). TREC efficiently detects similar communities through a combination of Locality Sensitive Hashing and Minhashing. We provide experimental evidence on four benchmark datasets and real dynamic datasets such as AS, DBLP, Yelp, and Digg and compare them with the baseline work. The results show that TREC achieves an accuracy of about 98%, has a minimal space requirement, and is very close to the best performing work in terms of time complexity.

Investigating scholars' topic switching behavior quantitatively is essential for understanding the driving forces behind technological development in CS. However, the continuous growth of scientific publications poses challenges in accurately tracking scholars' topic switching. To address this, this study utilizes a large-scale dataset from the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) to construct bibliographic coupling networks for 16,794 scholars, enabling the detection of their research topics using the Louvain algorithm. Subsequently, this study introduces a novel two-dimensional metric to quantify scholars' topic switching behavior: topic switching degree and topic switching probability. This metric enables the classification of scholars into four distinct types: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Our analysis reveals that the majority of scholars belong to Type B, characterized by high topic switching probability but low degree, correlating with the highest quantity, quality, and citations of publications. Scholars categorized as Type A and Type D follow, while those falling under Type C, indicating low topic switching probability but high degree, tend to have the lowest publications and citations. Employing these new two-dimensional indicators to measure scholars' topic switching behavior and exploring its relationship with research performance contribute to advancements in technology within the field of computer science.","[Yin, Dehu] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Yin, DH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",1019209055@tju.edu.cn,"Yin, Dehu/JTT-2792-2023",,The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program [20220615ZZ07110404],The 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program,This work was supported by the 2022 Science and Technology Think Tank Young Talent Program under Grant 20220615ZZ07110404.,,52,0,0,5,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,,104263.0,104271.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434546,0.0,,,9,Telecommunications,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,C0V8F,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001286635200001,0,Telecommunications

These analyses highlight the heterogeneity and dysfunctionality of MATT cells in HCC and their defective capacity to infiltrate liver tumors. Machine-learning tools were used to dissect the spatial cellular interaction network within the MATT cell neighborhood. Co-localization in the adjacent liver and interaction between niche-occupying CSF1R+PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MATT cells was identified as a key regulatory element of MATT cell dysfunction. Perturbation of this cell-cell interaction in ex vivo co-culture studies using patient samples and murine models reinvigorated MATT cell cytotoxicity.

To address this noise, we developed SpotGF, an algorithm for denoising SRT data using optimal transport-based gene filtering. SpotGF quantifies diffusion patterns numerically, distinguishing widespread expression genes from aggregated expression genes and filtering out the former as noise. Unlike conventional denoising methods, SpotGF preserves raw sequencing data, thereby avoiding false positives that can arise from imputation. Additionally, SpotGF demonstrates superior performance in cell clustering, identifying potential marker genes, and annotating cell types. Overall, SpotGF has the potential to become a crucial preprocessing step in the downstream analysis of SRT data. The SpotGF software is freely available at GitHub.

Such information provides a solid foundation for mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in both health and disease that cannot be obtained by using traditional technologies. The development of computational methods plays important roles in extracting biological signals from raw data. Various approaches have been developed to overcome technology-specific limitations such as spatial resolution, gene coverage, sensitivity, and technical biases. Downstream analysis tools formulate spatial organization and cell-cell communications as quantifiable properties, and provide algorithms to derive such properties. Integrative pipelines further assemble multiple tools in one package, allowing biologists to conveniently analyze data from beginning to end. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of spatial transcriptomic data analysis methods and pipelines, and discuss how they operate on different technological platforms.","[Dries, Ruben; Chen, Jiaji; Khan, Mohammed Muzamil] Boston Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Dries, Ruben; Khan, Mohammed Muzamil] Boston Univ, Bioinformat Grad Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Dries, Ruben; Khan, Mohammed Muzamil] Boston Univ, Sect Computat Biomed, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Del Rossi, Natalie; Sistig, Adriana; Yuan, Guo-Cheng] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Charles Bronfman Inst Personalized Med, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yuan, Guo-Cheng] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Precis Immunol Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA",Boston University; Boston University; Boston University; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Dries, R (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;Dries, R (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Bioinformat Grad Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Dries, R (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sect Computat Biomed, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;Yuan, GC (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Charles Bronfman Inst Personalized Med, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA.;Yuan, GC (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Precis Immunol Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA.",rdries@bu.edu; guo-cheng.yuan@mssm.edu,,"Dries, Ruben/0000-0001-7650-7754; Sistig, Adriana/0000-0002-0211-3629; Khan, Mohammed Muzamil/0000-0003-4502-2660","National Institutes of Health (National Institute on Aging) [UH3HL145609, R01AG066028]",National Institutes of Health (National Institute on Aging)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We thank Dr. Long Cai and his laboratory members (in particular, Michal Polonsky, Arun Chakraborty, and Yujing Yang) for reading our manuscript and helpful feedback.

MATT cells are assigned crucial roles in regulating immunity and inflammation, yet their role in liver cancer remains elusive. Here, we present a MATT cell-centered profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and co-detection by indexing (CODEX) imaging of paired patient samples. These analyses highlight the heterogeneity and dysfunctionality of MATT cells in HCC and their defective capacity to infiltrate liver tumors. Machine-learning tools were used to dissect the spatial cellular interaction network within the MATT cell neighborhood. Co-localization in the adjacent liver and interaction between niche-occupying CSF1R+PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MATT cells was identified as a key regulatory element of MATT cell dysfunction. Perturbation of this cell-cell interaction in ex vivo co-culture studies using patient samples and murine models reinvigorated MATT cell cytotoxicity. These studies suggest that aPD-1/aPD-L1 therapies target MATT cells in HCC patients.","[Ruf, Benjamin; Benmebarek, Mohamed-Reda; Ma, Chi; Heinrich, Bernd; Subramanyam, Varun; Qi, Jonathan; Wabitsch, Simon;

Genetically barcoded genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) zebrafish were used to screen for factors expressed by the sinusoidal vascular niche that alter the phylogenetic distribution of the HSC pool under native conditions. Dysregulated expres-sion of protein kinase C delta (PKC-8, encoded by prkcda) increases the number of HSC clones by up to 80% and expands polyclonal populations of immature neutrophil and erythroid precursors. PKC agonists such as cxcl8 augment HSC competition for residency within the niche and expand defined niche populations. CXCL8 induces association of PKC-8 with the focal adhesion complex, activating extracellular signal-regulated ki-nase (ERK) signaling and expression of niche factors in human endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate the existence of reserve capacity within the niche that is controlled by CXCL8 and PKC and has significant impact on HSC phylogenetic and phenotypic fate.","[Binder, Vera] Ludwig Maximillians Univ, Dr von Hauner Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol, Univ Hosp, D-80337 Munich, Germany; [Li, Wantong; Faisal, Muhammad; Oyman, Konur; Calkins, Donn L.; Shaffer, Jami; Teets, Emily M.; Sher, Steven; Magnotte, Andrew; Belardo, Alex; Deruelle, William; Gregory, T.

Yet when analyzing spatial transcriptomics data, effective integration of expression and spatial information poses considerable analytical challenges. Although many methods have been developed to address this issue, many are platform specific and lack the general applicability to analyze diverse datasets. In this article, we propose a method called the weighted ensemble method for spatial transcriptomics (WEST) that utilizes ensemble techniques to improve the performance and robustness of spatial transcriptomics data analytics. We compare the performance of WEST with six methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. WEST represents a significant advance in detecting spatial domains, offering improved accuracy and flexibility compared to existing methods, making it a valuable tool for spatial transcriptomics data analytics.","[Cai, Jiazhang; Wu, Shushan; Zhong, Wenxuan; Ma, Ping] Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, 310 Herty Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Cheng, Huimin] Boston Univ, Dept Biostat, 801 Massachusetts Ave,Crosstown Ctr, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Yuan, Guo-Cheng] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, 1468 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Boston University; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Zhong, WX; Ma, P (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, 310 Herty Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Yuan, GC (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, 1468 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA.",wenxuan@uga.edu; guo-cheng.yuan@mssm.edu; pingma@uga.edu,"Wu, Shushan/JAZ-0321-2023",,"US National Science Foundation [DMS-1925066, DMS-1903226, DMS-2124493, DMS-2311297, DMS-2319279, DMS-2318809]; US National Institute of Health [R01GM152814, RF1MH128970, RF1MH133703]",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The authors would like to acknowledge support from the US National Science Foundation under grants DMS-1925066, DMS-1903226, DMS-2124493, DMS-2311297, DMS-2319279, and DMS-2318809 and the US National Institute of Health under grants R01GM152814, RF1MH128970, and RF1MH133703.",,37,0,0,4,4,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",2667-2375,,,CELL REP METHODS,Cell Reports Methods,NOV 18,2024,4.0,11,,,,,,,100886,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100886,0.0,,NOV 2024,14,Cell Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,M9O8V,39515332.0,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001360760200001,0,Cell Biology

This technology has allowed the identification of cell types and states, providing new insights into cellular susceptibilities and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative conditions. Exciting research using high throughput scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq technologies to study AD and PD is emerging. Herein we review the recent progress in understanding these neurodegenerative diseases using these state-of-the-art technologies. We discuss the fundamental principles and implications of single-cell sequencing of the human brain.

Stochastic block partitioning (SBP) is a community detection algorithm based on sequential Bayesian inference. SBP is highly accurate even on graphs with a complex community structure. However, it does not scale well to large real-world graphs that can contain upwards of a million vertices due to its sequential nature. Approximate methods that break computational dependencies improve the scalability of SBP via parallelization and data reduction. However, these relaxations can lead to low accuracy on graphs with complex community structure. In this paper, we introduce additional synchronization steps through vertex-level data batching to improve the accuracy of such methods. We then leverage batching to develop a high-performance parallel approach that improves the scalability of SBP while maintaining accuracy. Our approach is the first to integrate data reduction, shared-memory parallelization, and distributed computation, thus efficiently utilizing distributed computing resources to accelerate SBP. On a one-million vertex graph processed on 64 compute nodes with 128 cores each, our approach delivers a speedup of 322x over the sequential baseline and 6.8x over the distributed-only implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this Graph Challenge submission is the highest-performing SBP implementation to date and the first to process the one-million vertex graph using SBP.","[Wanye, Frank; Feng, Wu-chun] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Gleyzer, Vitaliy; Kao, Edward] MIT, Lincoln Lab, Lexington, MA USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Lincoln Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wanye, F (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",wanyef@vt.edu; vgleyzer@ll.mit.edu; edward.kao@ll.mit.edu; wfeng@vt.edu,"Feng, Wu/LPQ-8249-2024",,"Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force [FA8702-15-D-0001]; NSF I/UCRC via the NSF Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC) [CNS-1822080]","Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force; NSF I/UCRC via the NSF Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC)","This material is based upon work supported by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force Contract No. FA8702-15-D-0001.

It works as an embedder of both the network structure and domain-specific features making the aforementioned challenges feasible to address. In this paper, we elaborate on the validation of AVPRA by adopting it in multiple downstream Machine Learning tasks on the Twitter network of the Italian Parliament. Comparing the outcome with state-of-the-art algorithms of graph embedding, the capability of AVPRA in retaining either network structure properties or domain-specific features of the nodes is promising.

Current hierarchical community-discovery algorithms generally consider a single node as a community during the initial stage. This approach leads to over-fine clustering granularity, too-deep clustering levels, and other issues. Therefore, this article proposes a hierarchical community-discovery algorithm that combines the core nodes and the three-order structure model. Between neighboring nodes, there is a first-order structure. The core node is identified based on its influence, and the similarity between the core node and its neighboring nodes is defined as the second-order structure. The nodes satisfying the second-order structure are then formed into a friend circle. The similarity between friend circles is defined as the third-order structure. According to this structure, the friend circles are construed as a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) where one HCT represents a community. The HCT built by this algorithm has relatively fewer levels and exhibits a flat feature. Experimental results on both artificial and real networks show that the algorithm performs well on various indicators. Additionally, the algorithm exhibits near-linear time complexity.","[Guo Lei; Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Li Shaozi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang Sheng; Wu Qingshou] Educ Dept Fujian Prov, Key Lab Cognit Comp & Intelligent Informat Proc F, Wuyishan, Peoples R China; [Guo Lei; Wu Qingshou] Digital Fujian Tourism Big Data Inst, Fujian Dev & Reform Commiss, Wuyishan, Fujian, Peoples R China","Wuyi University, Fujian; Xiamen University","Wu, QS (corresponding author), Wuyi Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wuyishan, Peoples R China.",wyswuqsh@163.com,"Li, SZ/G-3959-2010","guo, lei/0000-0001-7269-971X","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University [2019LSAF03]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2019J01835]; Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions [KLCCIIP2018107]","Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions","TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Smart Agriculture and Forestry (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Fujian Province University, Grant/Award Number: 2019LSAF03; The Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019J01835; TheOpen Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Intelligent Information Processing of Fujian Education Institutions, Grant/Award Number: KLCCIIP2018107",,57,0,0,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

These threads can enable users to easily interpret a hierarchical association of diverse evolving information about an event or discussion. In particular, HINT deploys a scalable architecture based on network community detection to effectively identify hierarchical links between documents based on their chronological relatedness and answers to the 5W1H questions (i.e., who, what, where, when, why & how). On the NewSHead collection, we show that HINT markedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of the identified threads.

To track the evolution of scientific communities and dig into the mechanism behind it, we formulate the task of event-based Group Evolution Pre-diction and apply interpretable machine learning approaches to the task. Seven evolution events for prediction are defined based on the evolution chains of scientific communities detected from the collaboration network. By using a detailed feature set, including topological, external, core node, and temporal attributes, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest are adopted for the prediction models. Experiments on the dataset of Library and Information Science shows that Random Forest performs the best, with the F1 scores of five events greater than 0.60. Shapley Ad-ditive exPlanations measure is applied to interpret the best model, i.e., quantify the contributions of features. It is observed that connectivity within a community has the most crucial influence, and community size, research topic consistency, research topic diversity, average node age, and the ratio of intermediary nodes play vital roles. The proposed methodology offers a solution to unearth the underlying mechanisms of the evolution of scientific communities, and the findings could be useful for scholars and policymakers to monitor scientific communities and take proac-tive actions.","[Tian, Yunpei; Li, Gang; Mao, Jin] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Informat Resources, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Yunpei; Li, Gang; Mao, Jin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Li, G; Mao, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Informat Resources, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",imiswhu@aliyun.com; danveno@163.com,"Mao, Jin/E-4941-2013","Mao, Jin/0000-0001-9572-6709","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72174154, 71804135, 71921002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank Jing Tang for the data collection.

Two examples of important web technologies used in health are news media and patient forums. Both have a significant role in shaping patients' perspective and behaviour in relation to health and illness, as well as the way that they might choose or change their treatment. In this paper, the authors investigated the application of web technologies using the data analysis approach. The authors did this analysis from the point of view of topics being discussed and disseminated via patients and journalists in breast and lung cancer. The study also investigated the (dis)alignment amongst these two groups and scientists in terms of topics. Design/methodology/approach - Three data sets comprised documents published between 2014 and 2018 obtained from ProQuest and Web of Science Medline databases, alongside data from three major patient forums on breast and lung cancer. The analysis and visualisation in this paper have been done using the udpipe, igraph R packages and VOSviewer. Findings - The study's findings showed that in general scientists focussed more on prognosis and treatment of cancer, whereas patients and journalists focussed more on detection, prevention and role of social and emotional support. The only exception was for news coverage of lung cancer where the largest cluster was related to treatment, research in cancer treatment and therapies. However, when comparing coverage by scientists and journalists in terms of treatment, the focus of news articles in both cancer types was mainly on chemotherapy and complimentary therapies. Finally, topics such as lifestyle or pain management were only discussed by breast cancer patients. Originality/value - The results obtained from this study may provide valuable insights into topics of interest for each group of scientists, journalist and patients as well as (dis)alignment among them in terms of topics. These findings are important as scientific research is heavily dependent on communication, and research does not exist in a bubble. Scientists and journalists can gain insights from patients' experiences and needs, which in turn may help them to have a more holistic and realistic view.

Such relatedness measures are commonly based on overlapping references (i.e., bibliographic coupling) or citations (i.e., co-citation) and can then be used with cluster analysis to find boundaries between research fields. Unfortunately, calculating a relatedness measure is challenging, especially for a large number of items, because the computational complexity is greater than linear. We propose an alternative method for identifying research fronts that uses direct citation inspired by relatedness measures. Our novel approach simply replicates a node into two distinct nodes: a citing node and cited node. We then apply typical clustering methods to the modified network. Clusters of citing nodes should emulate those from the bibliographic coupling relatedness network, while clusters of cited nodes should act like those from the co-citation relatedness network. In validation tests, our proposed method demonstrated high levels of similarity with conventional relatedness-based methods. We also found that the clustering results of the proposed method outperformed those of conventional relatedness-based measures regarding similarity with natural language processing-based classification.

To fill the gap between time series data analysis and complex network theory, the main objective is to capture spatio-temporal patterns of TBM dynamic excavation behavior from a topological structure perspective, which can provide valuable insights into geological information and over excavation ratio for intelligent tunneling project management. To accomplish this goal, the principal component analysis (PCA) is firstly utilized to reduce the dimension of the multivariate and heterogenous dataset for simplicity. Afterward, the time-lagged cross correlation (TLCC) and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) are implemented to measure the similarity between two segment rings for network graphing, resulting in a holistic view of the TBM excavation performance. Through the case study, network analysis results indicate that: (1) Leiden outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms in dividing the whole network into four high-quality communities. (2) There is a trend for segment rings with more similar excavation behavior and geological conditions to be gathered into the same community. (3) Since the over excavation ratio in four communities derived from the DTW-based complex network is proven to be significantly different, global sensitivity analysis is deployed to find out the most crucial features for decisionmaking in TBM control. The novelty to be highlighted is the developed time series analysis approach relying on the complex network perspective, which is helpful in effectively detecting relationships along with hidden engineering knowledge among rings. This has potential value in better understanding and improving the TBM tunneling performance under the underground environment with great complexity and uncertainty.","[Pan, Yue; Zhou, Xiaojing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infras, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Shuigen] Shanghai Mechanized Construct Grp, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Natl Ctr Technol Innovat Digital Construct, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; zlm@hust.edu.cn,"Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016; Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201171, 72271101]; Shanghai Sailing Program, China [22YF1419100]; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province [2022CFA062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program, China; Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72201171 and 72271101) , the Shanghai Sailing Program, China (No: 22YF1419100) , and the Outstanding Youth Fund of Hubei Province (No. 2022CFA062) .",,69,9,9,14,54,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

Compression of the graph allows for the development of community detection as well as providing a simpler graph. By examining the contact networks developed by an evolutionary algorithm for compression, it is discovered that the choice of fitness function and the appropriate weighting of edges leads to a different compressed graph, finding different connected communities; this is also true when compared to the communities identified by the Louvain community detection algorithm. This demonstrates the importance of considering weighting in contact networks, and suggests that in the future an understanding of the community structure should be utilized by public health officials.","[Rutkowski, Emilia; Sargant, James; Houghten, Sheridan] Brock Univ, Dept Comp Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Brown, Joseph Alexander] Innopolis Univ, AI Games Dev Lab, Innopolis, Russia",Brock University; Innopolis University,"Rutkowski, E (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Comp Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada.",er13iq@brocku.ca; js17sy@brocku.ca; shoughten@brocku.ca; j.brown@innopolis.ru,"Brown, Joseph/HTS-9117-2023",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,34,1,1,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-8392-3,IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT,,,2021,,,,,,,434.0,441.0,,10.1109/CEC45853.2021.9504833,0.0,,,8,Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Operations Research & Management Science,BS2MS,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000703866100055,0,Operations Research & Management Science

Users can generate multiple pairs of public and private keys to trade with multiple bitcoin addresses. Discovering the relationships between these addresses and clustering the addresses of individual users helps infer the identity of the addresses. By analyzing the association of addresses in UTXO, it is found that multiple input addresses of a transaction are controlled by the same user, and thus the bitcoin addresses can be clustered. The transactions between the user data obtained after clustering are communality, so the Louvain algorithm is further used to analyze the relationship between users, the visual results are used to present the association between users, and the impact of the number of users on the algorithm results is analyzed. Finally, the Leiden algorithm proposed to solve the problem that Louvain algorithm may have poor connectivity or even disconnection between communities is used to discover the community of the clustered user data.

Recently, many similarity functions have been introduced to cluster nodes of the same type, but tightness relationship between the nodes inside the clusters always remained as an issue. Another important issue is that for some difficult cases like selecting a community for a node that equally belongs to more than one community which may create an ambiguity in determining the node's best-fit community remain unaddressed in many community discovery algorithms. A single wrong prediction about a node's community may lead to an incorrect prediction for other nodes, resulting in a poor community structure. To address such issues, a Neighbour Based Community Detection(NBCD) algorithm based on two novel similarity measures using a similarity parameter alpha and a set of ground rules are proposed in this work. The similarity parameter alpha provides a choice for the user to select the tightness of the nodes within the communities. The NBCD algorithm is a two-step process: one is community detection and the next is node shifting. Extensive experiments are carried out on real-world benchmark data sets and artificial networks to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. NBCD algorithm is compared with several recent and state-of-the-art community discovery algorithms. Normalized Mutual Information(NMI), Adjusted Mutual Information(AMI), Adjusted Rand Index(ARI), F-measure and Modularity are used as the performance measures. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm, NBCD, performs well with respect to all the performance measures and performs better than the other community detection algorithms considered.","[Sahu, Shailendra; Rani, T.

Although it is celebrated for its efficiency, its greedy nature poses certain challenges, especially in scenarios involving sparsely connected communities. Our study proposes an innovative method that enhances the performance of the Louvain algorithm without increasing its computational complexity. We explore the core applications of this method, seeking to refine and optimize the Louvain algorithm's performance.

However, training on biomedical data presents significant challenges as they are often high dimensional, clustered, and of limited sample size. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple and scalable approach for cluster-aware embedding that combines latent factor methods with a convex clustering penalty in a modular way. Our novel approach overcomes the complexity and limitations of current joint embedding and clustering methods and enables hierarchically clustered principal component analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Through numerical experiments and real-world examples, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms fourteen clustering methods on highly underdetermined problems (e.g., with limited sample size) as well as on large sample datasets. Importantly, our approach does not require the user to choose the desired number of clusters, yields improved model selection if they do, and yields interpretable hierarchically clustered embedding dendrograms. Thus, our approach improves significantly on existing methods for identifying patient subgroups in multiomics and neuroimaging data and enables scalable and interpretable biomarkers for precision medicine.","[Buch, Amanda M.; Liston, Conor; Grosenick, Logan] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med, Dept Psychiat, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Buch, Amanda M.; Liston, Conor; Grosenick, Logan] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med, BMRI, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine,"Buch, AM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med, Dept Psychiat, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Buch, AM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med, BMRI, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",amb2022@med.cornell.edu; col2004@med.cornell.edu; log4002@med.cornell.edu,,,Ford Foundation Post-doctoral Fellowship; New Venture Fund grant [NVF 202423-01]; NIMH Stephen I.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of such initialization applied to the two most commonly used community detection algorithms: Louvain and Leiden. We use a partition obtained by embedding the nodes of the graph into some high dimensional space of real numbers and then running a clustering algorithm on this latent representation. We show that this procedure significantly improves the results. Proper embedding filters unnecessary information while retaining the proximity of nodes belonging to the same community. As a result, clustering algorithms ran on these embeddings merge nodes only when they are similar with a high degree of certainty, resulting in a stable and effective initial partition.","[Pankratz, Bartosz; Pralat, Pawel] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pankratz, Bartosz; Kaminski, Bogumil] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland",Toronto Metropolitan University; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pankratz, B (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Pankratz, B (corresponding author), SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland.",bartosz.pankratz@ryerson.ca; bkamins@sgh.waw.pl; pralat@ryerson.ca,"Kamiński, Bogumił/AAF-5417-2020; Pankratz, Bartosz/JFA-6346-2023","Pankratz, Bartosz/0000-0001-7618-9119",,,,,34,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-031-21133-1; 978-3-031-21131-7; 978-3-031-21130-0,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2023,1078.0,,,,,,221.0,232,,10.1007/978-3-031-21131-7_17,0.0,,,12,"Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BU9UI,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000963499200017,0,"Mathematics, Applied"

We identify and analyze the Matthew effect incurred by the classical quality function based methods, which essentially results in the imbalanced allocation of perturbation resources. To mitigate such effect, we propose a probabilistic framework named as ProHiCo to hide communities. The key idea of ProHiCo is to first allocate the resource of perturbations randomly and fairly and then choose the appropriate edges to perturb via likelihood minimization. Our ProHiCo framework provides the additional freedom to choose the generative graph model with community structure. By incorporating the stochastic block model and its degree-corrected variant into the ProHiCo framework, we develop two scalable and effective algorithms called SBM and DCSBM. Via extensive experiments on 8 real-world networks and 5 community detection algorithms, we show that both SBM and DCSBM are about 30x faster than the prominent baselines in the literature when there are around 500 target communities, while their performance is comparable to the baselines.","[Liu, Xuecheng; Fu, Luoyi; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hopcroft, John E.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Cornell University,"Liu, XC (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",liuxuecheng@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; jeh@cs.cornell.edu,"chen, cheng/AAE-4460-2019; Wang, Guishuan/HHZ-1516-2022",,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100302]; NSF China [62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012]",National Key R&D Program of China; NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China 2018YFB2100302, and NSF China under Grant (No. 62020106005, 61822206, 61960206002, 61829201, 61832013, 62041205, 61532012).",,32,5,5,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-166X,,978-0-7381-1281-7,IEEE INFOCOM SER,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488870,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BS2JU,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000702210400204,0,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture"

Conventional graph clustering is typically governed by a function defined over all possible cluster configurations but at a fixed value of the resolution hyperparameter denoted as gamma. Such clustering suffers from issues related to the so-called resolution limit or requires resolution tuning. This has been changed by recent theories and algorithms for graph clustering with resolution variation. The requirement for specifying or tuning the gamma-hyperparameter is effectively removed, and the clustering function becomes or transforms to a functional form with gamma as an internal resolution variable. We address a standing and significant challenge in parallel clustering with resolution variation. We identify and remove the key bottlenecks in search operations confined to a specific gamma value, and reduce and minimize redundant search operations at different gamma values. We show impressive performance achieved with our parallel approach on real-world datasets.","[Pitsianis, Nikos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Pitsianis, Nikos; Floros, Dimitris; Liu, Tiancheng; Sun, Xiaobai] Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Liu, Tiancheng] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Pitsianis, N (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.;Pitsianis, N (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,"Pitsianis, Nikos/LMO-8753-2024","Pitsianis, Nikos/0000-0002-7353-3524",,,,,48,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2377-6943,,979-8-3503-0860-0,IEEE HIGH PERF EXTR,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/HPEC58863.2023.10363552,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BW4YB,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001156959800058,0,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture"

Drawing from the literature of the sociology of sciences, it defends a community-centered approach of the study of mathematical practice, and assesses the role of the notion of metamathematics in mathematical change and in stabilized mathematical practices. It relies on the case study of the emergence of geometric control theory at the beginning of the 1970s and of the citational practices associated to the community of control theory since the mid 1990s. This case study shows that the introduction of geometric tools in control theory at the end of the 1960s induced a change in the metamathematical views that control theorists had on their objects. I then demonstrate how membership to the community of control theory shapes the production and the reception of the theorems of Stefan, Sussmann and Nagano. Interpreting the historical development and citational practices of this community through the perspective of metamathematics, I conclude by discussing the role of the orbit theorem in control theory, both as a cognitive label and as a social marker of membership to this community.","[Lavau, Sylvain] Inst Euler EIMI, Pesochnaya Nab 10, St Petersbourg 197022, Russia",,"Lavau, S (corresponding author), Inst Euler EIMI, Pesochnaya Nab 10, St Petersbourg 197022, Russia.",lavau@math.univ-lyon1.fr,,,,,,,106,0,0,0,1,SOC ANTHROPOLOGIE CONNAISSANCES,"MARNE LA VALLEE, CEDEX 02","C/O MARC BARBIER, UNIV PARIS MARNE VALEE, CITE DESCARTES CHAMPS MARNE, MARNE LA VALLEE, CEDEX 02, 77 454, FRANCE",1760-5393,,,REV ANTHROPOL CONNAI,Rev.

This approach enabled us to identify five distinct trends, each highlighting specific aspects and the geographical diversity of visual artists' careers, which were then evaluated using a thematic map. The main findings revealed that working conditions, income inequalities, and professional practices in the creative and cultural industries stand out as a central and influential theme, with a significant impact and notable advances that have shaped recent discussions and practices. The themes professional dynamics, cultural policies, and career strategies in contemporary art and dynamics of artistic careers, resilience, and support policies in contemporary art are well-developed and have a solid research base, offering an in-depth understanding of the relevant topics. The theme positioning and success strategies of artists in the contemporary art market represents an emerging theme that is receiving increasing attention and is likely to become prominent, while the theme gender inequalities, geographical mobility, and dynamics of artistic clusters indicates a waning influence for various reasons. The results obtained aim to provide concrete guidance to researchers and the institutions that confer legitimacy in the visual arts world.

In this study, we used a multiomics approach to characterize the supragingival plaque microbiome of 91 Australian children, generating 658 bacterial and 189 viral metagenome-assembled genomes with transcriptional profiling and gene-expression network analysis. We developed a reproducible pipeline for clustering sample-specific genomes to integrate metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses regardless of biosample overlap. We introduce novel feature engineering and compositionally-aware ensemble network frameworks while demonstrating their utility for investigating regime shifts associated with caries dysbiosis. These methods can be applied when differential abundance modeling does not capture statistical enrichments or the results from such analysis are not adequate for providing deeper insight into disease. We identified which organisms and metabolic pathways were central in a coexpression network as well as how these networks were rewired between caries and caries-free phenotypes. Our findings provide evidence of a core bacterial microbiome that was transcriptionally active in the supragingival plaque of all participants regardless of phenotype, but also show highly diagnostic changes in the ways that organisms interact. Specifically, many organisms exhibit high connectedness with central carbon metabolism to Cardiobacterium and this shift serves a bridge between phenotypes. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that caries is a multifactorial ecological disease.","[Espinoza, Josh L.; Dupont, Chris L.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Espinoza, Josh L.; Kuelbs, Claire; Nelson, Karen E.; Dupont, Chris L.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Human Biol & Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Espinoza, Josh L.; Torralba, Manolito; Singh, Suren; Nelson, Karen E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Dept Human Biol & Genom Med, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Leong, Pamela; Saffery, Richard; Craig, Jeffrey M.] Univ Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Epigenet, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Leong, Pamela; Saffery, Richard; Craig, Jeffrey M.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Hughes, Toby] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Dent Sch, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Craig, Jeffrey M.] Deakin Univ Sch Med, IMPACT Strateg Res Ctr, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",J.

For efficient community detection in a social network, the influence node plays a vital role. A node in the social network or a user that has great influence and power would have a close relationship with a core of the group, termed a community. Therefore, the status of a person is determined by the user's influence strength. That is, a user who has greater influence and strength plays a vital role in the social media community and also acts as a core in the community of the social network. Therefore, a community is a group of nodes in the complex network structure which are interlinked with one another. Effective community detection in a complex structure is a challenging task. Many studies have been done based on topological networks. The approaches are ineffective, inefficient and require more time to process. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes improving the influence nodes in complex networks by using the InfoMap with sigmoid fish swarm optimization algorithm (I-SFSO). Our proposed I-SFSO gives better accuracy rates for the data sets: 92% for Dolphin, 95% for the Facebook dataset, 96% for the Twitter data set, 94% for the YouTube data set, 93% for a karate club and 94% for football.","[Selvaraj, Devi; Murugasamy, Rajalakshmi] Coimbatore Inst Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Coimbatore 641014, India",Coimbatore Institute of Technology,"Selvaraj, D (corresponding author), Coimbatore Inst Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Coimbatore 641014, India.",devi.s@cit.edu.in,"Rajalakshmi, M/AAI-1193-2020","S, Devi/0000-0002-9527-0913; M, Rajalakshmi/0000-0002-9229-5971",,,,,33,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE",3 PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, 3 PRAGUE, 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",,1805-4951,,ACTA INFORM PRAG,Acta Inform.

By exploiting open-source software, DOSNs allow users to create their own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way. Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of study on user relations and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions: understanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their membership instance and/or across different instances, and unveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it represents the most widely used DOSN platform. We believe that the findings drawn from our study on Mastodon users' roles and information flow can pave a way for further development of fascinating research on DOSNs.","[La Cava, Lucio; Greco, Sergio; Tagarelli, Andrea] Univ Calabria, Dept Comp Engn Modeling Elect & Syst Engn DIMES, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Tagarelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Comp Engn Modeling Elect & Syst Engn DIMES, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",lucio.lacava@dimes.unical.it; greco@dimes.unical.it; tagarelli@dimes.unical.it,"Torres, Andrea/HLP-6166-2023; La Cava, Lucio/AFV-5293-2022","La Cava, Lucio/0000-0003-3324-0580",,,,,34,14,14,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2468-6964,,ONLINE SOC NETW MED,Online Soc.

This, together with the emergence of platforms such as Wikipedia, has challenged traditional views on the relationship between current events and historical accounts of events, with an ever-shrinking divide between news and history. Wikipedia's place as the Internet's primary reference work thus poses the question of how it represents both traditional encyclopaedic knowledge and evolving important news stories. In other words, how is information on and attention towards current events integrated into the existing topical structures of Wikipedia? To address this, we develop a temporal community detection approach towards topic detection that takes into account both short term dynamics of attention as well as long term article network structures. We apply this method to a dataset of one year of current events on Wikipedia to identify clusters of Wikipedia articles related to news events, distinct from those that would be found solely from page view time series correlations or static network structure. We are able to resolve the topics that more strongly reflect unfolding current events vs more established knowledge by the relative importance of collective attention dynamics vs link structures. We also offer important developments by identifying and describing the emergent topics on Wikipedia. This work provides a means of distinguishing how these information and attention clusters are related to Wikipedia's twin faces of encyclopaedic knowledge and current events-crucial to understanding the production and consumption of knowledge in the digital age.","[Gildersleve, Patrick] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lambiotte, Renaud] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Yasseri, Taha] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Sociol, Dublin, Ireland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University College Dublin,"Gildersleve, P (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.gildersleve@lse.ac.uk,"Lambiotte, Renaud/C-1085-2009; Yasseri, Taha/AAK-9213-2021; Gildersleve, Patrick/IWM-2673-2023","Yasseri, Taha/0000-0002-1800-6094; Lambiotte, Renaud/0000-0002-0583-4595","EPSRC [EP/V03474X/1, EP/V013068/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,100,3,3,1,7,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2432-2717,2432-2725,,J COMPUT SOC SCI,J.

Furthermore, we also suggest a way to assign sub-networks divided by community extraction methods to the source network and the validation network to select pre-labeling nodes, which is a significant challenge for multiple-role discovery in real-world networks.

This heterogeneity can represent different ways in which psychological processes manifest, either between people or within a person across time. In many instances, those differences can have systematic patterns that can be related to future outcomes. In close relationships, for example, the daily exchange of affect between two individuals in a couple can contain a particular structure that is different across people and can result in varying levels of relationship satisfaction. In this paper we use Louvain, a clustering method, as a tool to characterize heterogeneity in multivariate time series data. Using affect measures from dyadic interactions, we first determine that Louvain is adept at detecting homogeneous patterns that are distinct from one another. Additionally, these homogeneous points are linked, at some level, by time. Thus, we find that clustering via Louvain is useful to find time periods of stable, reoccurring patterns. However, using measures founded on information theory reveals that there is some level of information loss that is inevitable when clustering on levels of variable expression. Finally, we evaluate the predictive validity of the clustering method by examining the relation between the identified clusters of affect and measures outside the time series (i.e., relationship satisfaction and breakup taken one and two years later).","[Aragones, Samuel D.; Ferrer, Emilio] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA USA; [Aragones, Samuel D.] Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Aragones, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sdaragones@ucdavis.edu,,"Aragones, Samuel/0000-0002-5071-797X; Ferrer, Emilio/0000-0001-7520-046X",,,,,56,0,0,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0027-3171,1532-7906,,MULTIVAR BEHAV RES,Multivariate Behav.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of such initialization applied to the two most commonly used community detection algorithms: Louvain and Leiden. We use a partition obtained by embedding the nodes of the graph into some high dimensional space of real numbers and then running a clustering algorithm on this latent representation. We show that this procedure significantly improves the results. Proper embedding filters unnecessary information while retaining the proximity of nodes belonging to the same community. As a result, clustering algorithms ran on these embeddings merge nodes only when they are similar with a high degree of certainty, resulting in a stable and effective initial partition.","[Pankratz, Bartosz; Pralat, Pawel] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pankratz, Bartosz; Kaminski, Bogumil] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland",Toronto Metropolitan University; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pankratz, B (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Pankratz, B (corresponding author), SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland.",bartosz.pankratz@ryerson.ca; bkamins@sgh.waw.pl; pralat@ryerson.ca,"Kamiński, Bogumił/AAF-5417-2020; Pankratz, Bartosz/JFA-6346-2023","Pankratz, Bartosz/0000-0001-7618-9119",,,,,34,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-031-21133-1; 978-3-031-21131-7; 978-3-031-21130-0,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2023,1078.0,,,,,,221.0,232,,10.1007/978-3-031-21131-7_17,0.0,,,12,"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BU9UI,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000963499200017,0,"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"

Applying a community detection algorithm results in a division of a network into communities that is often used to inspect and reason about community membership of specific nodes. This micro-level interpretation step of community structure is a crucial step in typical social science research. However, the methodological caveat in this step is that virtually all modern community detection methods are non-deterministic and based on randomization and approximated results. This needs to be explicitly taken into consideration when reasoning about community membership of individual nodes. To do so, we propose a metric of community membership consistency, that provides node-level insights in how reliable the placement of that node into a community really is. In addition, it enables us to distinguish the community core members of a community. The usefulness of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on corporate board interlock networks, in which weighted links represent shared senior level directors between firms. Results suggest that the community structure of global business groups is centered around persistent communities consisting of core countries tied by geographical and cultural proximity. In addition, we identify fringe countries that appear to associate with a number of different global business communities.","[van Kuppevelt, Dafne E.; Bakhshi, Rena] Netherlands eSci Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Heemskerk, Eelke M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Takes, Frank W.] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"van Kuppevelt, DE (corresponding author), Netherlands eSci Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Takes, FW (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands.",d.vankuppevelt@esciencecenter.nl; takes@uva.nl,"Heemskerk, Eelke/E-4872-2012; Takes, Frank/G-8038-2016","Takes, Frank/0000-0001-5468-1030; Heemskerk, Eelke/0000-0001-7356-5318; Bakhshi, Rena/0000-0002-2932-3028",Netherlands eScience Center,Netherlands eScience Center,This research was partly funded by the Netherlands eScience Center.,,37,0,0,2,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2432-2717,2432-2725,,J COMPUT SOC SCI,J.

Measures are a function of a network's structure and a given partition. Previous approaches extend classical centrality measures to account for community structure with little connection to community detection theory. In contrast, we propose cluster-quality vitality measures, i.e., modularity vitality, a community-aware measure which is well-grounded in both centrality and community detection theory. Modularity vitality quantifies positive and negative contributions to community structure, which indicate a node's role as a community bridge or hub. We derive a computationally efficient method of calculating modularity vitality for all nodes in O(M + NC) time, where C is the number of communities. We systematically fragment networks by removing central nodes, and find that modularity vitality consistently outperforms existing community-aware centrality measures. We show measures well-grounded in community theory are over 8 times more effective on a million-node infrastructure network. This result does not generalize to social media communication networks, which exhibit extreme robustness to all community-aware centrality attacks. This robustness suggests that user-based interventions to mitigate misinformation diffusion will be ineffective.

It is classified as an NP-class problem, and several algorithms have been proposed with specific objectives. There also exist various quality metrics for evaluating them. Having clusters with the required density can be beneficial because it permits the effective deployment of resources. This study proposes an approach to partitioning and overlapping clustering of undirected unweighted graphs, allowing users to specify the required density of resultant clusters. This required density is achieved by means of 'Relative Density'. The proposed algorithm adopts an edge-based approach, commencing with the determination of the edge degree for each edge. The main clustering process is then initiated by an edge with an average degree. A cluster is expanded by considering adjacent edges that can be included while monitoring the relative density of the cluster. Eight empirical networks with diverse characteristics are used to validate the proposed algorithm for both partitioning and overlapping clustering. Their results are assessed using an appropriate metric known as the mean relative density deviation coefficient (MRDDC).

Despite the fruitful research outcomes of community detection, the discovery of irregular-shaped and statistically significant dynamic communities in vehicle movements is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an evolutionary ant colony optimization (EACO) method for detecting dynamic communities in vehicle movements. Firstly, a weighted, spatially embedded graph was constructed at each time snapshot. Then, an ant-colony-optimization-based spatial scan statistic was upgraded to identify statistically significant communities at each snapshot by considering the effects of the communities discovered at the previous snapshot. Finally, different rules defined based on the Jaccard coefficient were used to identify the evolution of the communities. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world vehicle movement datasets showed that EACO performs better than three representative dynamic community detection methods: FacetNet (a framework for analyzing communities and evolutions in dynamic networks), DYNMOGA (dynamic multi-objective genetic algorithm), and RWLA (random-walk-based Leiden algorithm).

As an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the particle competition mechanism, stochastic competitive learning has been applied in the field of community detection in complex networks, but still has several limitations. In order to improve the stability and accuracy of stochastic competitive learning and solve the problem of community detection, we propose an unsupervised community detection algorithm LNSSCL (Local Node Similarity-Integrated Stochastic Competitive Learning). The algorithm calculates node degree as well as Salton similarity metrics to determine the starting position of particle walk; local node similarity is incorporated into the particle preferential walk rule; the particle is dynamically adjusted to control capability increments according to the control range; particles select the node with the strongest control capability within the node to be resurrected; and the LNSSCL algorithm introduces a node affiliation selection step to adjust the node community labels. Experimental comparisons with 12 representative community detection algorithms on real network datasets and synthetic networks show that the LNSSCL algorithm is overall better than other compared algorithms in terms of standardized mutual information (NMI) and modularity (Q). The improvement effect for the stochastic competition learning algorithm is evident, and it can effectively accomplish the community detection task in complex networks.","[Huang, Jian; Gu, Yijun] Peoples Publ Secur Univ China, Coll Informat & Cyber Secur, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",People's Public Security University of China,"Gu, YJ (corresponding author), Peoples Publ Secur Univ China, Coll Informat & Cyber Secur, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",2021211442@stu.ppsuc.edu.cn; guyijun@ppsuc.edu.cn,,,Double-class Special Project on Cyberspace Security and Law Enforcement Technology of the Chinese People's Public Security University [2023SYL07],Double-class Special Project on Cyberspace Security and Law Enforcement Technology of the Chinese People's Public Security University,This research was funded by the Double-class Special Project on Cyberspace Security and Law Enforcement Technology of the Chinese Peoples Public Security University (2023SYL07).,,52,0,0,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

To preserve such communi-ties, it is important to understand their robustness under network perturbations. Previous work in community robustness analysis has focused on studying changes in the community structure as a response of edge rewiring and node or edge removal. However, the impact of increasing connectivity on the robustness of communities in networked systems is relatively unexplored. Studying the limits of community robustness under edge addition is crucial to better understanding the cases in which density expands or false edges erroneously appear. In this paper, we analyze the effect of edge addition on community robustness in synthetic and empirical temporal networks. We study two scenarios of edge addition: random and targeted. We use four community detection algorithms, Infomap, Label Propagation, Leiden , Louvain, and demonstrate the results in community similarity metrics. The experiments on synthetic networks show that communities are more robust when the initial partition is stronger or the edge addition is random, and the experiments on empirical data also indicate that robustness performance can be affected by the community similarity metric. Overall, our results suggest that the communities identified by the different types of community detection algorithms exhibit different levels of robustness, and so the robustness of communities depends strongly on the choice of detection method.","[Tian, Moyi] Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Moriano, Pablo] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Comp Sci & Math Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",Brown University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Tian, MY (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",moyi_tian@brown.edu; moriano@ornl.gov,"; Moriano, Pablo/AAC-6334-2021","Tian, Moyi/0000-0001-8166-7410; Moriano, Pablo/0000-0002-1822-8885",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,"This paper has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

Document clustering is vital in areas like information retrieval, knowledge management, and marketing, underscoring the need for a highly accurate clustering model. Current models in document clustering face significant hurdles, such as dealing with sparse, high -dimensional representations based on the bag -of -words (BOW) approach, which are not only computationally demanding on large datasets but also lack in capturing the semantic nuances of documents. Additionally, these models struggle with determining the ideal number of clusters and managing datasets with overlapping elements. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel co -clustering strategy that merges community detection methods from social network analysis with advanced text analysis techniques. The proposed method transforms documents into a network structure, where each document is a node and connections (edges) are formed between documents that are most similar. Community detection algorithms are then employed to identify clusters within this network of documents. The study explores various document representation methods, including topic modelling and sentence embedding, to provide a rich contextual understanding of the documents. An extensive evaluation is carried out, examining different combinations of community detection algorithms, clustering methodologies, and document representation strategies, particularly focusing on their efficacy in handling overlapping and non -overlapping datasets. The findings demonstrate that the Element -Centric evaluation measure is effective in enabling community detection algorithms to autonomously ascertain the most suitable number of clusters, yielding promising results for both overlapping and non -overlapping datasets. The LCD model shows remarkable performance in addressing overlapping datasets. Furthermore, the research reveals that innovative document representation approaches significantly enhance the performance of the models. Additionally, the use of topic modelling in conjunction with co -clustering algorithms proves effective in clearly depicting the themes within the clusters.","[Amiri, Babak; Karimianghadim, Ramin] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Amiri, B (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran.",babakamiri@iust.ac.ir,"amiri, babak/U-7672-2018",,,,,,87,3,3,4,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0960-0779,1873-2887,,CHAOS SOLITON FRACT,Chaos Solitons Fractals,APR,2024,181.0,,,,,,,,114633,10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114633,0.0,,MAR 2024,12,"Physics, Mathematical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Physics,NW3L8,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001203452300001,0,"Physics, Mathematical"

As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.","[Jerdee, Maximilian; Newman, M.

Suitably conducted community detection reveals various embedded informative substructures of network topology. However, regarding the practical usage of community detection, it has always been a tricky problem to assign a reasonable community resolution for networks of interest. Because of the absence of the unanimously accepted criterion, most of the previous studies utilized rather ad hoc heuristics to decide the community resolution. In this work, we harness the concept of consistency in community structures of networks to provide the overall community resolution landscape of networks, which we eventually take to quantify the reliability of detected communities for a given resolution parameter. More precisely, we exploit the ambiguity in the results of stochastic detection algorithms and suggest a method that denotes the relative validity of community structures in regard to their stability of global and local inconsistency measures using multiple detection processes. Applying our framework to synthetic and real networks, we confirm that it effectively displays insightful fundamental aspects of community structures.","[Lee, Daekyung; Kim, Beom Jun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile.",lshlj82@gnu.ac.kr; kimheetae@gmail.com,"Kim, Heetae/S-3876-2019","Lee, Sang Hoon/0000-0003-3079-5679; Kim, Heetae/0000-0002-5688-2626","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [20194010000290]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2018R1C1B5083863, NRF-2021R1C1C1004132]; National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT [11190096]","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of KoreaKorea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation & Planning (KETEP)); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT","D.L. and B.J.K. were supported by Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), granted financial resource from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea (Grant No. 20194010000290), S.H.L. was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea Grants No. NRF-2018R1C1B5083863 and No. NRF-2021R1C1C1004132, and H.K. was supported by the National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT No. 11190096.",,31,10,10,1,11,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",2470-0045,2470-0053,,PHYS REV E,Phys.

The critical tasks in ScRNA-seq data analysis are clustering and dimensionality reduction. Recent deep clustering algorithms are used to optimize the two tasks jointly, and their variations, graph-based deep clustering algorithms, are used to capture and preserve topological information in the process. However, the existing graph-based deep clustering algorithms ignore the distribution information of nodes when constructing cell graphs which leads to incomplete information in the embedding representation; and graph convolutional networks (GCN), which are most commonly used, often suffer from over-smoothing that leads to high sample similarity in the embedding representation and then poor clustering performance. Here, the dual-GCN-based deep clustering with Triplet contrast (scDGDC) is proposed for dimensionality reduction and clustering of scRNA-seq data. Two critical components are dual-GCN-based encoder for capturing more comprehensive topological information and triplet contrast for reducing GCN over-smoothing. The two components improve the dimensionality reduction and clustering performance of scDGDC in terms of information acquisition and model optimization, respectively. The experiments on eight real ScRNA-seq datasets showed that scDGDC achieves excellent performance for both clustering and dimensionality reduction tasks and is high robustness to parameters.","[Wang, Linjie; Xie, Weidong; Wang, Rui] Northeastern Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp Med Image MIIC, Shenyang 110000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kun] Northeastern Univ, Coll Med & Bioinformat Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China,"Li, W (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp Med Image MIIC, Shenyang 110000, Peoples R China.",2110696@stu.neu.edu.cn; liwei@cse.neu.edu.cn; 1910638@stu.neu.edu.cn; 2101806@stu.neu.edu.cn; yukun@bmie.neu.edu.cn,"Yu, Kun/GQY-9364-2022","Min, Xin/0000-0002-1996-7241; Wang, LinJie/0009-0004-2028-7501","National key research and development program, China [2022JH2/101300075]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [B16009]; National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project; [2021YFC2701003]","National key research and development program, China; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province); National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project;","?This work was supported by the research project funded by National key research and development program, China (2021YFC2701003) , Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province under grant (2022JH2/101300075) , the National Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimization the 111 Project (B16009) .",,55,3,3,5,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1476-9271,1476-928X,,COMPUT BIOL CHEM,Comput.

Here, we revisit Leonard Hayflick's original observation of replicative senescence in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts equipped with a battery of modern techniques including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq. We find evidence that the transition to a senescent state manifests early, increases gradually, and corresponds to a concomitant global increase in DNA accessibility in nucleolar and lamin associated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that senescent WI-38 cells acquire a striking resemblance to myofibroblasts in a process similar to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by t YAP1/TEAD1 and TGF-beta 2.

Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable because this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects because there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single-cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single-cell transcriptome-specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise, it is difficult to ascertain which method functions best. Results: We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP, single-cell Pick Optimal Parameters) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and cell type/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile-based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and 3 species to create a massive ocular single-cell transcriptome meta-atlas. Conclusions: This provides a model for how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.","[Swamy, Vinay S.; McGaughey, David M.] NEI, Bioinformat Grp, Ophthalm Genet & Visual Funct Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fufa, Temesgen D.; Hufnagel, Robert B.] NEI, Med Genet & Ophthalm Genom Unit, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI),"McGaughey, DM (corresponding author), 10 Ctr Dr,Room 10B16, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mcgaugheyd@mail.nih.gov,,"McGaughey, David/0000-0002-9224-2888; Fufa, Temesgen/0000-0002-8298-0051","Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health [EY000469]","Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health (grant No. EY000469), awarded to Brian Brooks.",,68,15,17,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2047-217X,,,GIGASCIENCE,GigaScience,OCT,2021,10.0,10,,,,,,,giab061,10.1093/gigascience/giab061,0.0,,,12,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,2A8VC,34651173.0,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000809772400001,0,Biology

This paper presents examples on how the digitalisation of chemical processes as graphs can facilitate their study and analysis for developing alternative process designs. In a process graph, inputs, outputs and unit operations are represented as nodes and streams are edges which can be weighted using process variables such as flow rate. Once a process is represented as a graph, community detection algorithms can be applied to identify process modules and obtain their modularity. The novel approach presented is based on modular decompositions to identify highly related unit operations in a flowsheet which can be analysed for insightful directions to improve a chemical process. The approach showed to be helpful in analysing a biofuel production process by adopting a combined economic and greenhouse gas emissions analysis at a modular level for hot spot analysis and identification of opportunities for decarbonisation. In an application to process integration, CO2 capture and utilisation networks are analysed in terms of its modularity and efficiency in processing CO2. In both cases, the improved designs had higher modularity values suggesting a correlation between modularity and technical performance which needs to be investigated further. Finally, prospective applications of modularity and modular decomposition approaches to realise several digitalisation tasks are presented.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias] Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,,,Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant [540821111]; IMP [Y.62001],Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant; IMP,"This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

This process of DMAs creation is characterized by two stages: the partitioning of the system and the allocation of control devices. However, improving the management of supply networks is often only possible through the optimal allocation and operation of control devices in the pipelines. In this sense, this study proposes the implementation of different DMAs configurations with objective of costs, pressures, and water age minimization. For this work, hybrid algorithms are developed, consisting of the partitioning algorithms already established in the literature, Fast-Greedy and Louvain, and of the optimization algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The hybrid algorithms were implemented in the Python and Matlab programming languages. In this study, the Modena benchmark network has been used as a case study and the establishing DMAs have been made for single-objective optimizations. The results obtained are compared by analyzing hydraulic criteria, cost, modularity (connectivity) and frequency of valves allocated to the pipes. In general, the hybrid algorithms formed by Louvain algorithm obtained the best results.","[Anchieta, Thomaz Felipe de Freitas; Meirelles, Gustavo; Brentan, Bruno Melo] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Anchieta, TFD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.",thomazfelipe94@ufmg.br; gustavo.meirelles@ehr.ufmg.br; brentan@ehr.ufmg.br,,"Felipe de Freitas Anchieta, Thomaz/0000-0003-1792-3111",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil - Finance Code 001.,,69,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

For many of these molecules, property data have not been measured yet and need to be estimated to determine suitability to a particular application. For example, viscosity is a key property in the development of green solvents, fuel additives, and biofuels. This paper proposes the use of modularity as a molecular descriptor combined with functional group counts to estimate molecular properties using neural network models. The modularity of molecules was determined from graph representations using community detection algorithms. The potential for this approach was demonstrated for the modeling of viscosity at 25 degrees C and applied to biomass-derived molecules. The model performances showed that including modularity contributed to more accurate estimations than viscosity models existing in the literature. Furthermore, modularity on its own can be useful to estimate viscosity for n-alkanes, esters, isoalkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, and cycloalkanes. This was due to the capacity of modularity to capture the structural features of the molecules employed in the data set. As such, modularity exhibited its tremendous potential to be exploited for property estimation, supporting the screening, rational design, and engineering of green chemicals derived from biomass.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Valencia, Diego; Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero; Aburto, Jorge] Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico; [Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Chem, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021; Aburto, Jorge/B-4600-2009","Aburto, Jorge/0000-0002-8282-6046; MARTINEZ HERNANDEZ, ELIAS/0000-0002-2789-7239; Valencia, Diego/0000-0002-2877-2841",[D.61074],,The authors would like to acknowledge Project D.61074 (IMP) for financial support.,,36,13,13,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Multiobjective optimization provides an ideal framework for analyzing sustainability tradeoffs, but when four or more objectives are considered, the ability to rigorously solve problems and interpret results is lost. This necessitates an approach to systematically reduce the dimensionality of many objective problems to three or fewer objectives. In this work, an algorithm to group objectives based on their correlating nature a priori to solving the full space problem is proposed. It utilizes community detection on a novel weighted objective correlation graph to identify two or three groups of correlated objectives. Results from three representative case studies demonstrate that objective groupings obtained from this algorithm minimize the amount of tradeoff information lost and outperform intuitive groupings by economics or the environment.","[Russell, Justin M.

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.","[Liu, Qiliang; Hou, Zhaoyi; Yang, Jie] Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jie_yang@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41971353, 41730105]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ20058, 2020JJ4695]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province [KT202110, KT202002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded through support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 41971353 and 41730105), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2021JJ20058 and 2020JJ4695), and the water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province (No. KT202110 and KT202002).",,43,1,1,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4144,10.3390/rs14174144,0.0,,,20,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4K1ZE,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000851756200001,0,Environmental Sciences

First, velocity-based filtering and region of interest (ROI) extraction were employed to filter and associate point data by merging the point cloud frames to enhance the point relationship. Then, the Louvain algorithm was used to divide the graph into modularity by converting the point cloud data into graph structure and amplifying the differences with the Gaussian kernel function. Finally, a detection augmentation method is introduced to address the problems of over-clustering and under-clustering based on the object ID characteristics of 4D MMW radar data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method obtained the highest average precision and F1 score: 98.15% and 98.58%, respectively.

Most studies to date have only focused on the effect of specific disorders on infection severity, without considering that patients usually present multiple chronic diseases and that these conditions tend to group together in the form of multimorbidity patterns. In this large-scale epidemiological study, including primary and hospital care information of 166,242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from the Spanish region of Andalusia, we applied network analysis to identify multimorbidity profiles and analyze their impact on the risk of hospitalization and mortality. Our results showed that multimorbidity was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and that this risk increased with the morbidity burden. Individuals with advanced cardio-metabolic profiles frequently presented the highest infection severity risk in both sexes. The pattern with the highest severity associated in men was present in almost 28.7% of those aged >= 80 years and included associations between cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases; age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (1.71 (1.44-2.02)). In women, similar patterns were also associated the most with infection severity, in 7% of 65-79-year-olds (1.44 (1.34-1.54)) and in 29% of >= 80-year-olds (1.35 (1.18-1.53)). Patients with mental health patterns also showed one of the highest risks of COVID-19 severity, especially in women. These findings strongly recommend the implementation of personalized approaches to patients with multimorbidity and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the population with high morbidity burden.","[Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas] Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, WHO Collaborating Ctr Drug Stat Methodol, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Drug Stat, Div Hlth Data & Digitalisat, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca] Spanish Soc Family & Community Med SEMFYC, Drug Utilizat Work Grp, Barcelona 08009, Spain; [Munoyerro-Muniz, Dolores; Rodriguez-Herrera, Juliana; Antonio Goicoechea-Salazar, Juan; Villegas-Portero, Roman] Serv Andaluz Salud SAS, Subdirecc Tecn Asesora Gest Informac, Seville 41071, Spain",Miguel Servet University Hospital; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain.",jcarmona@iisaragon.es; ignatios.ioakeimskoufa@fhi.no; agimenomi.iacs@aragon.es; bpoblador.iacs@aragon.es; franciscagonzalezrubio@gmail.com; dolores.munoyerro.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; juliana.rodriguez.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; jantonio.goicoechea@juntadeandalucia.es; sprados.iacs@aragon.es; romanp.villegas@juntadeandalucia.es,"Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/AAX-4807-2020; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/GPT-3556-2022; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz/ABC-7915-2020; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio/AAC-9611-2019; Carmona Pirez, Jonas/AAE-8594-2022; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/P-5818-2017; Villegas, Roman/J-9159-2016","Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/0000-0002-6518-749X; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/0000-0001-5939-4436; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio/0000-0002-5440-1710; Carmona-Pirez, Jonas/0000-0002-6268-8803; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/0000-0002-5704-6056; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz/0000-0002-5119-5093; Villegas, Roman/0000-0003-0845-0172","Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Gobierno de Aragon [B01_20R, DECRETO-LEY 3/2020]; European Union-NextGenerationEU",Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon; Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Gobierno de Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Union-NextGenerationEU,"This work was cofunded by Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon and Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Rio Hortega Program, grant number CM19/00164; RICAPPS, grant number RD21/0016/0019), Gobierno de Aragon (Grant numbers B01_20R and DECRETO-LEY 3/2020, de 3 de junio, del Gobierno de Aragon) and the European Union-NextGenerationEU.",,58,4,4,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

These spatial flows are for crude petroleum, gasoline, and oil fuels. The analysis shows that all three fuels have different network topology. For all six networks we find major hubs of crude petroleum and its products, gasoline and fuel oils, concentrated in areas with large reserves such as the south-central part of the US. Using modularity, a network cluster identification metric, we show that spatial interactions can be used to delineate functional regions and their differences across fuel types. These functional regions evolve over time in response to the shifting US role as a major producer and net exporter of fossil fuels, expansion of the domestic pipeline network, and increases in fuel production and refinement locations. The modal split of the fuels examined in this paper shows the dominant role pipelines play for crude petroleum, transporting approximately 83 % of tonnage in 2017 and increasing to almost 89 % in 2022. In contrast, gasoline and oil fuels modal split hovers at around 60 % of tonnage transported by tanker truck followed by other modes including pipelines. Our analysis shows geographic clustering of major hubs and their functional regions along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana. These are in places that are often the locations of natural disasters. This together with the rapid increase of a few hubs as gateways to fossil fuel US exports makes them prime candidates in disrupting fossil fuel supply chains worldwide and amplifies vulnerability of fossil fuel supply chains. The spatial clustering trends shown in this paper provide added evidence of the source of short-term negative impacts in places such as Chicago in Illinois and Corpus Christi in Texas. This offers added information for government intervention.","[Goulias, Konstadinos G.; Shi, Hui] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Goulias, KG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",kgoulias@UCSB.edu,"Shi, Hui/LZE-8238-2025",,,,,,68,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This study uses cancer care as an example to illustrate the methodology, with the nine-state Northeast Region of the USA as the study area. Two recent algorithms of network community detection are implemented to account for additional constraints such as spatial connectivity and threshold region size. The refined methods are termed spatially constrained Louvain (ScLouvain) and spatially constrained Leiden (ScLeiden) algorithms, corresponding to their predecessors the Louvain and Leiden algorithms, respectively. Both are network optimization methods that maximize flows within delineated communities while minimizing inter-community flows. The service areas derived by the methods, termed cancer service areas, are more favorable than the commonly used comparable unit, hospital referral regions, for evaluating cancer-specific variations in care. Between the two, the ScLeiden performs better than the ScLouvain in terms of modularity, localization index and computational efficiency, and thus is recommended as an effective and efficient approach for defining functional regions.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,"Wang, Changzhen/HPH-2043-2023; Wang, Fahui/H-4302-2013","Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024; Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",National Cancer Institute (US) [R21CA212687],National Cancer Institute (US)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"National Cancer Institute (US), Grant/Award Number: R21CA212687",,27,24,28,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-1682,1467-9671,,T GIS,Trans.

An improved Leiden method based on the gravity model is used to construct a preliminary zoning scheme, which is then modified by spatial constraints. The modularity index demonstrates the suitability of this method for community detection. This method can minimize cut-off traffic flows between pandemic control areas. The results show that only 24.8% of travel links are disrupted using our method, which could reduce both the impact of pandemic control on the daily life of residents and its cost.

The rational service areas (RSAs) are defined to represent local healthcare markets and used as the basic units to evaluate whether people have access to health resources. Therefore, finding an appropriate way to develop RSAs is important for understanding the utilization of health resources and supporting accurate resource allocation to the health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Existing RSAs are usually developed based on the local knowledge of public health needs and are created through time-intensive manual work by health service officials. In this research, a travel data-driven and spatially constrained community detection method based on human mobility flow is proposed to automate the process of establishing the statewide RSAs and further identifying HPSAs based on healthcare criteria in a geographic information system (GIS) software. The proposed method considers the difference between rural and urban populations by assigning different parameters and delineates RSAs with the goal of reducing health resource inequalities faced by rural areas. Using the data in the State of Wisconsin, our experiment shows that the proposed RSA delineation method outperforms other baselines including the traditional Dartmouth method in the aspects of RSA compactness, region size balances, and health shortage scores. Furthermore, the whole process of delineating RSAs and identifying HPSAs is automated using Python toolboxes in ArcGIS to support future analyses and practices in a timely and repeatable manner.","[Liang, Yunlei; Gao, Song] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, GeoDS Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gao, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, GeoDS Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",song.gao@wisc.edu,"Liang, Yunlei/ACA-4489-2022; Gao, Song/N-9573-2019","Gao, Song/0000-0003-4359-6302",,,"We would like to thank the SafeGraph Inc. for providing the data about anonymous location visits and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services Primary Care Program for providing the health resource data and thank Aleksandr Kladnitsky, Regina Vidaver, Penny Black, and Jaime Olson for their guidance on this research.",,31,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-1682,1467-9671,,T GIS,Trans.

It is classified as an NP-class problem, and several algorithms have been proposed with specific objectives. There also exist various quality metrics for evaluating them. Having clusters with the required density can be beneficial because it permits the effective deployment of resources. This study proposes an approach to partitioning and overlapping clustering of undirected unweighted graphs, allowing users to specify the required density of resultant clusters. This required density is achieved by means of 'Relative Density'. The proposed algorithm adopts an edge-based approach, commencing with the determination of the edge degree for each edge. The main clustering process is then initiated by an edge with an average degree. A cluster is expanded by considering adjacent edges that can be included while monitoring the relative density of the cluster. Eight empirical networks with diverse characteristics are used to validate the proposed algorithm for both partitioning and overlapping clustering. Their results are assessed using an appropriate metric known as the mean relative density deviation coefficient (MRDDC). This is the first work that attempts to carry out partitioning and overlapping graph clustering, which allows user-specified density.","[Tariq, Rohi; Lavangnananda, Kittichai; Mongkolnam, Pornchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Bouvry, Pascal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp Sci, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of Luxembourg,"Tariq, R; Lavangnananda, K (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",rohi.tariq@mail.kmutt.ac.th; kittichai.lav@gmail.com; pascal.bouvry@uni.lu; pornchai.mon@kmutt.ac.th,"Tariq, Rohi/LZE-7536-2025; Lavangnananda, Kittichai/ADK-6368-2022","Mongkolnam, Pornchai/0000-0001-6069-1315","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg",No Statement Available,,72,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, due to the high noise and heterogeneity of the single-cell data, it is challenging to infer cell trajectory in complex biological processes. Here, we proposed a new trajectory inference method, called Metric Learning Bhattacharyya Kernel Feature Decomposition (MLBKFD). In MLBKFD, a statistical model was used to infer cell trajectory by calculating the Markov transition matrix and Bhattacharyya kernel matrix between cells. Before that, to expedite the matrix calculation in the statistical model, a deep feedforward neural network was used to perform dimensionality reduction on single-cell data. The MLBKFD was evaluated on four typical datasets as well as seven recent human fetal lung datasets. Comparisons with the two outstanding methods (i.e., DTFLOW and MARGARET) demonstrate that the MLBKFD is capable of accurately inferring cell development and differentiation trajectories from single-cell data with different sizes and sources. Notably, MLBKFD exhibits nearly twice the speed of DTFLOW while maintaining high precision, particularly when dealing with large datasets. MLBKFD provides accurate and efficient trajectory inference, empowering researchers to gain deeper insights into the complex dynamics of cell development and differentiation.","[Han, Changfeng; Li, Cheng; Wang, Yuebin; Shi, Ya-Zhou; Zhang, Ben-Gong] Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wenjie] Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Math, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanbing] Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, P, R China, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China",Wuhan Textile University; Sun Yat Sen University; Wuhan Textile University,"Zhang, BG (corresponding author), Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Wuhan 430200, Peoples R China.",bgzhang@wtu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Ben-gong/D-6488-2013","Han, Changfeng/0009-0002-5266-8101; wang, yue bin/0009-0004-3756-7390; Guo, Yanbing/0009-0001-8147-1853; Zhang, Ben-gong/0000-0002-2766-6502; Li, Cheng/0009-0008-3882-7069; cao, wen jie/0009-0002-7112-1013; Shi, Ya-Zhou/0000-0003-2579-3134","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11971367, 12371500]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant numbers 11971367, 12371500].",,73,2,2,10,16,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2737-4165,2737-4173,,J COMPUT BIOPHYS CHE,J.

In order to improve the stability and accuracy of stochastic competitive learning and solve the problem of community detection, we propose an unsupervised community detection algorithm LNSSCL (Local Node Similarity-Integrated Stochastic Competitive Learning). The algorithm calculates node degree as well as Salton similarity metrics to determine the starting position of particle walk; local node similarity is incorporated into the particle preferential walk rule; the particle is dynamically adjusted to control capability increments according to the control range; particles select the node with the strongest control capability within the node to be resurrected; and the LNSSCL algorithm introduces a node affiliation selection step to adjust the node community labels. Experimental comparisons with 12 representative community detection algorithms on real network datasets and synthetic networks show that the LNSSCL algorithm is overall better than other compared algorithms in terms of standardized mutual information (NMI) and modularity (Q).

As the scale of geospatial knowledge graphs continues to grow, the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs is becoming an inevitable requirement. Geospatial knowledge graph partitioning is the core technology for the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs. To support geographic data analysis, spatial relationships between entities should be considered in the application of geospatial knowledge graphs. However, existing knowledge graph partitioning methods overlook the spatial relationships between entities, resulting in the low efficiency of spatial queries. To address this issue, this study proposes a geospatial knowledge graph partitioning method based on dual clustering which performs two different clustering methods step by step. First, the density peak clustering method (DPC) is used to cluster geographic nodes. The nodes within each cluster are merged into a super-node. Then, we use an efficient graph clustering method (i.e., Leiden) to identify the community structure of the graph. Nodes belonging to the same community are further merged to reduce the size of the graph. Finally, partitioning operations are performed on the compressed graph based on the idea of the Linear-Weighted Deterministic Greedy Policy (LDG). We construct a geospatial knowledge graph based on YAGO3 to evaluate the performance of the proposed graph partitioning method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms ten comparison methods in terms of graph partitioning quality and spatial query efficiency.","[Chen, Yuxuan; Ou, Feifei; Liu, Qiliang; Wu, Gusheng; Chen, Kaiqi; Deng, Min; Chen, Meihua] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Xu, Rui] Guizhou Survey & Design Res Inst Water Resources &, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Chen, KQ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",225001008@csu.edu.cn; 215012187@cus.edu.cn; qiliang.liu@csu.edu.cn; gushengwu@csu.edu.cn; chenkaiqi@csu.edu.cn; dengmin@csu.edu.cn; 215007008@csu.edu.cn; xiurui7@126.com,,"Chen, Kaiqi/0000-0001-7505-0764","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFB3900903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271484]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China [KT202410]; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province [HBZ20240132]","National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province","This research was funded through support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3900903), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271484), the Water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China (No. KT202410), and the Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province (Grant No. HBZ20240132).",,58,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Despite the fruitful research outcomes of community detection, the discovery of irregular-shaped and statistically significant dynamic communities in vehicle movements is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an evolutionary ant colony optimization (EACO) method for detecting dynamic communities in vehicle movements. Firstly, a weighted, spatially embedded graph was constructed at each time snapshot. Then, an ant-colony-optimization-based spatial scan statistic was upgraded to identify statistically significant communities at each snapshot by considering the effects of the communities discovered at the previous snapshot. Finally, different rules defined based on the Jaccard coefficient were used to identify the evolution of the communities. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world vehicle movement datasets showed that EACO performs better than three representative dynamic community detection methods: FacetNet (a framework for analyzing communities and evolutions in dynamic networks), DYNMOGA (dynamic multi-objective genetic algorithm), and RWLA (random-walk-based Leiden algorithm).

How these cellular populations engage the brain and modulate freezing across varying environmental demands is unclear. To address this, we optogenetically reactivated a fear engram in the dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus across three distinct contexts in male mice. We found that there were differential amounts of light-induced freezing depending on the size of the context in which reactivation occurred: mice demonstrated robust light-induced freezing in the most spatially restricted of the three contexts but not in the largest. We then utilized graph theoretical analyses to identify brain-wide alterations in cFos expression during engram reactivation across the smallest and largest contexts. Our manipulations induced positive interregional cFos correlations that were not observed in control conditions. Additionally, regions spanning putative fear and defense systems were recruited as hub regions in engram reactivation networks. Lastly, we compared the network generated from engram reactivation in the small context with a natural fear memory retrieval network. Here, we found shared characteristics such as modular composition and hub regions. By identifying and manipulating the circuits supporting memory function, as well as their corresponding brain-wide activity patterns, it is thereby possible to resolve systems-level biological mechanisms mediating memory's capacity to modulate behavioral states.","[Dorst, Kaitlyn E.; Senne, Ryan A.; Diep, Anh H.; de Boer, Antje R.; Suthard, Rebecca L.; Leblanc, Heloise; Ruesch, Evan A.; Pyo, Angela Y.; Skelton, Sara; Carstensen, Lucas C.; Malmberg, Samantha; McKissick, Olivia P.; Bladon, John H.; Ramirez, Steve] Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Dorst, Kaitlyn E.; Senne, Ryan A.; Suthard, Rebecca L.; Leblanc, Heloise; Carstensen, Lucas C.; Malmberg, Samantha] Boston Univ, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [de Boer, Antje R.] Univ Groningen, NL-9712CP Groningen, Netherlands; [Ruesch, Evan A.] MIT, Brain & Cognit Sci Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [McKissick, Olivia P.] Brown Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Boston University; Boston University; University of Groningen; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Brown University,"Ramirez, S (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dvsteve@bu.edu,"; Senne, Ryan Aaron/HZJ-0158-2023","Dorst, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5393-2608; de Boer, Antje Rixt/0009-0003-9986-4887; Suthard, Rebecca/0000-0002-0011-7028; Senne, Ryan Aaron/0000-0003-3776-4576; Carstensen, Lucas/0000-0003-2747-0275",Ludwig Family Foundation; NIH Early Independence Award [DP5 OD023106-01]; NIH Transformative R01 Award; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; McKnight Foundation Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Chan Zuckerberg Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-21-1-0310]; Neurophotonics Center at Boston University; Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University,Ludwig Family Foundation; NIH Early Independence Award; NIH Transformative R01 Award; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; McKnight Foundation Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Chan Zuckerberg Foundation(Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Neurophotonics Center at Boston University; Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University,"This work was supported by the Ludwig Family Foundation, an NIH Early Independence Award (DP5 OD023106-01) , an NIH Transformative R01 Award, a Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, the McKnight Foundation Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-21-1-0310) , the Neurophotonics Center at Boston University, and the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University.",,106,1,1,1,1,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Currently, there is no clear standard or systematic approach for selecting the most appropriate community detection method. Furthermore, the impact of method choice on the accuracy and robustness of estimated communities (and network modularity), as well as method-dependent relationships between network communities and cognitive and other individual measures, are not well understood. This study analyzed large datasets of real brain networks (estimated from resting-state fMRI from n$$ n $$ = 5251 pre/early adolescents in the adolescent brain cognitive development [ABCD] study), and n$$ n $$ = 5338 synthetic networks with heterogeneous, data-inspired topologies, with the goal to investigate and compare three classes of community detection methods: (i) modularity maximization-based (Newman and Louvain), (ii) probabilistic (Bayesian inference within the framework of stochastic block modeling (SBM)), and (iii) geometric (based on graph Ricci flow). Extensive comparisons between methods and their individual accuracy (relative to the ground truth in synthetic networks), and reliability (when applied to multiple fMRI runs from the same brains) suggest that the underlying brain network topology plays a critical role in the accuracy, reliability and agreement of community detection methods. Consistent method (dis)similarities, and their correlations with topological properties, were estimated across fMRI runs. Based on synthetic graphs, most methods performed similarly and had comparable high accuracy only in some topological regimes, specifically those corresponding to developed connectomes with at least quasi-optimal community organization. In contrast, in densely and/or weakly connected networks with difficult to detect communities, the methods yielded highly dissimilar results, with Bayesian inference within SBM having significantly higher accuracy compared to all others. Associations between method-specific modularity and demographic, anthropometric, physiological and cognitive parameters showed mostly method invariance but some method dependence as well. Although method sensitivity to different levels of community structure may in part explain method-dependent associations between modularity estimates and parameters of interest, method dependence also highlights potential issues of reliability and reproducibility. These findings suggest that a probabilistic approach, such as Bayesian inference in the framework of SBM, may provide consistently reliable estimates of community structure across network topologies. In addition, to maximize robustness of biological inferences, identified network communities and their cognitive, behavioral and other correlates should be confirmed with multiple reliable detection methods. Network communities are a fundamental characteristic of human brain's circuit organization. Community detection methods are differentially sensitive to the connectome topology and can yield highly dissimilar estimates, especially in underdeveloped brains, leading to method-dependent mappings to cognitive and other parameters. A probabilistic approach may be more robust than modularity-maximization and geometric methods. image","[Brooks, Skylar J.; Golding, Staunton G.

However, the molecular, cellular and anatomic heterogeneity underlying its functional diversity remains incompletely understood. In this study, we generated a cell census of the mouse NAc using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization, revealing a high level of cell heterogeneity in this brain region. Here we show that the transcriptional and spatial diversity of neuron subtypes underlie the NAc's anatomic and functional heterogeneity. These findings explain how the seemingly simple neuronal composition of the NAc achieves its highly heterogenous structure and diverse functions. Collectively, our study generates a spatially resolved cell taxonomy for understanding the structure and function of the NAc, which demonstrates the importance of combining molecular and spatial information in revealing the fundamental features of the nervous system. The authors generated a cell census of mouse nucleus accumbens using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed error-robust FISH.

Across 143 healthy, community-dwelling adults 19-79 years of age, we estimated structural network properties from diffusion-weighted imaging and functional network properties from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We confirmed previous reports of age-related decline in the strength and efficiency of structural networks, as well as in the connectivity strength within and between structural network modules. Functional networks, in contrast, exhibited age-related decline only in system segregation, a measure of the distinctiveness among network modules. Aging was associated with decline in a composite measure of fluid cognition, particularly tests of executive function. Functional system segregation was a significant mediator of age-related decline in executive function. Structural network properties did not directly influence the age-related decline in functional system segregation. The raw correlational data underlying the graph theoretical measures indicated that structural connectivity exerts a limited constraint on age-related decline in functional connectivity.

We used transcriptome data from PD patients with Braak stage information to understand underlying molecular mechanisms for the progress of the disease. We created networks of genes with continuously decreased/increased co-expression from control group to Braak 5-6 stages. These networks are significantly associated with PD-related mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic signalling among others. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm to the co-expression networks led to more specific modules enriched with neurodegeneration-related disease pathways, seizure, abnormality of coordination, and hypotonia. Furthermore, we showed that one of the co-expression networks is clustered into three major communities with dedicated molecular functions: (i) tubulin folding pathway, gap junction-related mechanisms, neuronal system; (ii) synaptic vesicle, intracellular vesicle, proteasome complex, PD genes; (iii) energy metabolism, mitochondrial mechanisms, oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, PD genes.

While most current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our approach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users and their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by small groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of communities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that accounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking Random Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before implementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network. Equipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more assertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial differences in community detection such as users' tendencies toward preferential attachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we also identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect of users' location and primary programming language, which was determined using a comparative method of contribution activities. Overall, this paper offers several promising methodological insights for both open-source software experts and network scholars interested in studying team formation.","[Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz] James Madison Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Kramer, Brandon L.; Calderon, J.

The former aims to partition the graph vertices into densely connected subsets, while the latter adopts a more ego-centric approach, focusing on a specific node or group of nodes to identify a densely-connected sub-graph that contains these query nodes. However, many real-world networks are characterized by uncertainty, leading to the notion of uncertain or probabilistic graphs. The transition from deterministic graphs to uncertain graphs introduces new challenges. We present USIWO, an efficient and practical solution for community search in unweighted uncertain graphs with edge uncertainty. In addition to being accurate, the approach utilizes an efficient data structure for storing only the relevant parts of the network in main memory, eliminating the need to store the entire graph, making it a valuable tool in finding the core of a community on very large uncertain graphs, when there is limited time and memory available. The algorithm operates through a one-node-expansion approach, based on the concepts of strong and weak links within a graph.

The dataset comprises 575 articles on social media-related PR topics from nine prominent PR journals spanning 2010 to 2020. Through a multi-level analysis, including macro, mezzo, and micro perspectives, the study reveals a predominately geographically homophilic landscape.

This phenomenon significantly hinders information dissemination across communities and fuels societal polarization. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for quantifying echo chambers. In this paper, we present the Echo Chamber Score (ECS), a novel metric that assesses the cohesion and separation of user communities by measuring distances between users in the embedding space. In contrast to existing approaches, ECS is able to function without labels for user ideologies and makes no assumptions about the structure of the interaction graph. To facilitate measuring distances between users, we propose EchoGAE, a self-supervised graph autoencoder-based user embedding model that leverages users' posts and the interaction graph to embed them in a manner that reflects their ideological similarity. To assess the effectiveness of ECS, we use a Twitter dataset consisting of four topics - two polarizing and two non-polarizing. Our results showcase ECS's effectiveness as a tool for quantifying echo chambers and shedding light on the dynamics of online discourse.","[Alatawi, Faisal; Sheth, Paras; Liu, Huan] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Alatawi, F (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",faalataw@asu.edu; psheth5@asu.edu; huanliu@asu.edu,,"Sheth, Paras/0000-0002-6186-6946",Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-21-1-4002],Office of Naval Research (ONR)(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research),This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) under contract/grant number N00014-21-1-4002.,,38,1,1,5,7,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2473-9928,2473-991X,979-8-4007-0409-3,PR I-A I C AD S N A,,,2023,,,,,,,38.0,45,,10.1145/3625007.3627731,0.0,,,8,Communication,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Communication,BW7KE,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:001191293500006,0,Communication

It is classified as an NP-class problem, and several algorithms have been proposed with specific objectives. There also exist various quality metrics for evaluating them. Having clusters with the required density can be beneficial because it permits the effective deployment of resources. This study proposes an approach to partitioning and overlapping clustering of undirected unweighted graphs, allowing users to specify the required density of resultant clusters. This required density is achieved by means of 'Relative Density'. The proposed algorithm adopts an edge-based approach, commencing with the determination of the edge degree for each edge. The main clustering process is then initiated by an edge with an average degree. A cluster is expanded by considering adjacent edges that can be included while monitoring the relative density of the cluster. Eight empirical networks with diverse characteristics are used to validate the proposed algorithm for both partitioning and overlapping clustering. Their results are assessed using an appropriate metric known as the mean relative density deviation coefficient (MRDDC). This is the first work that attempts to carry out partitioning and overlapping graph clustering, which allows user-specified density.","[Tariq, Rohi; Lavangnananda, Kittichai; Mongkolnam, Pornchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Bouvry, Pascal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp Sci, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of Luxembourg,"Tariq, R; Lavangnananda, K (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",rohi.tariq@mail.kmutt.ac.th; kittichai.lav@gmail.com; pascal.bouvry@uni.lu; pornchai.mon@kmutt.ac.th,"Tariq, Rohi/LZE-7536-2025; Lavangnananda, Kittichai/ADK-6368-2022","Mongkolnam, Pornchai/0000-0001-6069-1315","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg",No Statement Available,,72,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

As the scale of geospatial knowledge graphs continues to grow, the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs is becoming an inevitable requirement. Geospatial knowledge graph partitioning is the core technology for the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs. To support geographic data analysis, spatial relationships between entities should be considered in the application of geospatial knowledge graphs. However, existing knowledge graph partitioning methods overlook the spatial relationships between entities, resulting in the low efficiency of spatial queries. To address this issue, this study proposes a geospatial knowledge graph partitioning method based on dual clustering which performs two different clustering methods step by step. First, the density peak clustering method (DPC) is used to cluster geographic nodes. The nodes within each cluster are merged into a super-node. Then, we use an efficient graph clustering method (i.e., Leiden) to identify the community structure of the graph. Nodes belonging to the same community are further merged to reduce the size of the graph. Finally, partitioning operations are performed on the compressed graph based on the idea of the Linear-Weighted Deterministic Greedy Policy (LDG). We construct a geospatial knowledge graph based on YAGO3 to evaluate the performance of the proposed graph partitioning method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms ten comparison methods in terms of graph partitioning quality and spatial query efficiency.","[Chen, Yuxuan; Ou, Feifei; Liu, Qiliang; Wu, Gusheng; Chen, Kaiqi; Deng, Min; Chen, Meihua] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Xu, Rui] Guizhou Survey & Design Res Inst Water Resources &, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Chen, KQ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",225001008@csu.edu.cn; 215012187@cus.edu.cn; qiliang.liu@csu.edu.cn; gushengwu@csu.edu.cn; chenkaiqi@csu.edu.cn; dengmin@csu.edu.cn; 215007008@csu.edu.cn; xiurui7@126.com,,"Chen, Kaiqi/0000-0001-7505-0764","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFB3900903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271484]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China [KT202410]; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province [HBZ20240132]","National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province","This research was funded through support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3900903), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271484), the Water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China (No. KT202410), and the Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province (Grant No. HBZ20240132).",,58,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

As an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the particle competition mechanism, stochastic competitive learning has been applied in the field of community detection in complex networks, but still has several limitations. In order to improve the stability and accuracy of stochastic competitive learning and solve the problem of community detection, we propose an unsupervised community detection algorithm LNSSCL (Local Node Similarity-Integrated Stochastic Competitive Learning). The algorithm calculates node degree as well as Salton similarity metrics to determine the starting position of particle walk; local node similarity is incorporated into the particle preferential walk rule; the particle is dynamically adjusted to control capability increments according to the control range; particles select the node with the strongest control capability within the node to be resurrected; and the LNSSCL algorithm introduces a node affiliation selection step to adjust the node community labels. Experimental comparisons with 12 representative community detection algorithms on real network datasets and synthetic networks show that the LNSSCL algorithm is overall better than other compared algorithms in terms of standardized mutual information (NMI) and modularity (Q).

The Product Space, a graph representing industrial knowledge proximity, acts as a valuable tool for recommending diversified product offerings. These recommendations rely on the edges of the graph to identify suitable products. They can be improved by grouping similar products together, which results in more precise suggestions. Unlike the topology, the textual data in nodes of the Product Space graph are typically unutilized in graph clustering methods. In this context, we propose a novel approach for economic graph learning that incorporates learning node data alongside network topology. By applying this method to the Product Space dataset, we demonstrate how recommendations have been improved by presenting real-life applications. Our research employing a graph neural network demonstrates superior performance compared to methods like Louvain and I-Louvain.

Despite the fruitful research outcomes of community detection, the discovery of irregular-shaped and statistically significant dynamic communities in vehicle movements is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an evolutionary ant colony optimization (EACO) method for detecting dynamic communities in vehicle movements. Firstly, a weighted, spatially embedded graph was constructed at each time snapshot. Then, an ant-colony-optimization-based spatial scan statistic was upgraded to identify statistically significant communities at each snapshot by considering the effects of the communities discovered at the previous snapshot. Finally, different rules defined based on the Jaccard coefficient were used to identify the evolution of the communities. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world vehicle movement datasets showed that EACO performs better than three representative dynamic community detection methods: FacetNet (a framework for analyzing communities and evolutions in dynamic networks), DYNMOGA (dynamic multi-objective genetic algorithm), and RWLA (random-walk-based Leiden algorithm).

It merges as a new way to provide a systematic view and complementary information of COVID-19 progression in the US, enabling evidence-based responses towards pandemic intervention and prevention. To begin with, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US. Then, relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics, which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics. Lastly, the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement, community detection, and online random forest, which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic. It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer (DER) are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution. Social factors regarding the political party, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network. Moreover, the cluster-specific predictor based on online random forest and sliding window is proven useful in dynamically capturing and predicting the epidemiological trends for each community, which can reach the highest.","[Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Unwin, Juliette] MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, London, England; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Taichung 413310, Taiwan; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Theoret & Appl Informat, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Nanyang Technological University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chaoyang University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Theoretical & Applied Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg; h.unwin@imperial.ac.uk,"Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024; Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016","Unwin, Juliette/0000-0002-9120-4003","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore [04MNP000279C120, 04MNP002126C120]; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [04INS000423C120]","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University)","This study is supported by the Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore (No. 04MNP000279C120, No. 04MNP002126C120) and the Start-Up Grant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (No. 04INS000423C120) .",,58,17,17,7,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

However, the majority of current models fail to capture the physics of power flows and the heterogeneity of the grids under study. This study addresses this gap by comparing the levels of heterogeneity in continent-sized power grids in Europe and North America to reveal the underlying universality and heterogeneity of grid frequencies, electrical parameters, and topological structures. Empirical data analysis of grid frequencies from the Hungarian grid indicates that q-Gaussian distributions best fit simulations, with spatio-temporally correlated noise evident in the frequency spectrum. Comparing European and North American power grids reveals that employing homogeneous transmission capacities to represent power lines can lead to misleading results on stability, and nodal behavior is heterogeneous. Community structures of the continent-sized grids are detected, demonstrating that Chimera states are more likely to occur when studying only subsystems. A topographical analysis of the grids is presented to assist in selecting such subsystems. Finally, synchronization calculations are provided to illustrate the occurrence of Chimera states. The findings underscore the necessity of heterogeneous grid models for dynamic stability analysis of power systems.","[Hartmann, Balint] HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Energy Secur & Environm Safety, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Odor, Geza; Papp, Istvan; Deng, Shengfeng] HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Benedek, Kristof] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Muegyetem Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Deng, Shengfeng] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Informat Technol, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Kelling, Jeffrey] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fac Nat Sci, Inst Chem, Str Nationen 62, D-09111 Chemnitz, Germany; [Kelling, Jeffrey] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiat Phys, POB 51 01 19, D-01314 Dresden, Germany",HUN-REN; HUN-REN Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Shaanxi Normal University; Technische Universitat Chemnitz; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR),"Hartmann, B (corresponding author), HUN REN Ctr Energy Res, Inst Energy Secur & Environm Safety, POB 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary.",hartmann.balint@ek.hun-ren.hu; odor@mfa.kfki.hu,"Deng, Shengfeng/HTR-0131-2023","Deng, Shengfeng/0000-0002-1952-8599","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH [K146736]; ELKH grant [SA-44/2021]; Bolyai Janos Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); ELKH grant; Bolyai Janos Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences)","Support from the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office NKFIH (K146736) and from the ELKH grant SA-44/2021 is acknowledged.

To understand the spatiotemporal variability and bottom-up spontaneity of the diffusion of clean energy technologies, this study examined the spatiotemporal diffusion of Photovoltaic (PV) systems, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) across 1773 postcode areas in California over the past 35 years. The Bayesian change point detection algorithm (BCDA) was initially utilized to identify temporal change points in the evolution of these technologies, revealing their diffusion trends over time. Then, the Louvain community detection algorithm (LCDA) was employed to elucidate spatial diffusion patterns across regions, offering insights into the geographic proliferation of clean energy solutions. Furthermore, to forecast future distributions, the spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) model was applied, adeptly capturing the multi-stage, nonlinear characteristics of clean energy diffusion marked by significant spatiotemporal interactions. With historical data and spatial proximity, the STGCN model demonstrated fine forecasting precision (R<^>2 >= 0.78). This study validates the effectiveness of a graph network-based approach for analyzing the diffusion of clean energy technologies. It recommends policies tailored to account for technological maturity, geographic disparities, and diffusion stages, aiming for equitable and sustainable clean energy development in the region.","[Lan, Haifeng; Hou, Huiying (Cynthia)] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gou, Zhonghua] Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Urban Dev, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Wuhan University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Hou, HY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cynthia.hou@polyu.edu.hk,"Gou, Zhonghua/H-5621-2019; Wong, Man/JAN-7113-2023; Hou, Cynthia/AAV-2722-2021","Hou, Cynthia/0000-0002-4215-2673; Lan, haifeng/0000-0001-9611-2135","Hong Kong Polytechnic University: Start-up Fund for New Recruits [P0040305]; General Research Fund [15603920, 15609421]; Collaborative Research Fund [C5062-21GF]; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong, China; Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China [1-GD81]","Hong Kong Polytechnic University: Start-up Fund for New Recruits; General Research Fund; Collaborative Research Fund; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China","We acknowledge the California Distributed Generation Statistics group (CADGS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the US Department of Energy (NREL) for providing open-source data that was used in this study.

It is classified as an NP-class problem, and several algorithms have been proposed with specific objectives. There also exist various quality metrics for evaluating them. Having clusters with the required density can be beneficial because it permits the effective deployment of resources. This study proposes an approach to partitioning and overlapping clustering of undirected unweighted graphs, allowing users to specify the required density of resultant clusters. This required density is achieved by means of 'Relative Density'. The proposed algorithm adopts an edge-based approach, commencing with the determination of the edge degree for each edge. The main clustering process is then initiated by an edge with an average degree. A cluster is expanded by considering adjacent edges that can be included while monitoring the relative density of the cluster. Eight empirical networks with diverse characteristics are used to validate the proposed algorithm for both partitioning and overlapping clustering. Their results are assessed using an appropriate metric known as the mean relative density deviation coefficient (MRDDC). This is the first work that attempts to carry out partitioning and overlapping graph clustering, which allows user-specified density.","[Tariq, Rohi; Lavangnananda, Kittichai; Mongkolnam, Pornchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Bouvry, Pascal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp Sci, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of Luxembourg,"Tariq, R; Lavangnananda, K (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",rohi.tariq@mail.kmutt.ac.th; kittichai.lav@gmail.com; pascal.bouvry@uni.lu; pornchai.mon@kmutt.ac.th,"Tariq, Rohi/LZE-7536-2025; Lavangnananda, Kittichai/ADK-6368-2022","Mongkolnam, Pornchai/0000-0001-6069-1315","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg","Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT), Faculty of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Luxembourg",No Statement Available,,72,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Further integration with cell-type deconvolution analysis extends its application to datasets with any spatial resolution.

Despite the fruitful research outcomes of community detection, the discovery of irregular-shaped and statistically significant dynamic communities in vehicle movements is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an evolutionary ant colony optimization (EACO) method for detecting dynamic communities in vehicle movements. Firstly, a weighted, spatially embedded graph was constructed at each time snapshot. Then, an ant-colony-optimization-based spatial scan statistic was upgraded to identify statistically significant communities at each snapshot by considering the effects of the communities discovered at the previous snapshot. Finally, different rules defined based on the Jaccard coefficient were used to identify the evolution of the communities. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world vehicle movement datasets showed that EACO performs better than three representative dynamic community detection methods: FacetNet (a framework for analyzing communities and evolutions in dynamic networks), DYNMOGA (dynamic multi-objective genetic algorithm), and RWLA (random-walk-based Leiden algorithm).

As the scale of geospatial knowledge graphs continues to grow, the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs is becoming an inevitable requirement. Geospatial knowledge graph partitioning is the core technology for the distributed management of geospatial knowledge graphs. To support geographic data analysis, spatial relationships between entities should be considered in the application of geospatial knowledge graphs. However, existing knowledge graph partitioning methods overlook the spatial relationships between entities, resulting in the low efficiency of spatial queries. To address this issue, this study proposes a geospatial knowledge graph partitioning method based on dual clustering which performs two different clustering methods step by step. First, the density peak clustering method (DPC) is used to cluster geographic nodes. The nodes within each cluster are merged into a super-node. Then, we use an efficient graph clustering method (i.e., Leiden) to identify the community structure of the graph. Nodes belonging to the same community are further merged to reduce the size of the graph. Finally, partitioning operations are performed on the compressed graph based on the idea of the Linear-Weighted Deterministic Greedy Policy (LDG). We construct a geospatial knowledge graph based on YAGO3 to evaluate the performance of the proposed graph partitioning method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms ten comparison methods in terms of graph partitioning quality and spatial query efficiency.","[Chen, Yuxuan; Ou, Feifei; Liu, Qiliang; Wu, Gusheng; Chen, Kaiqi; Deng, Min; Chen, Meihua] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Xu, Rui] Guizhou Survey & Design Res Inst Water Resources &, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Chen, KQ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Info Phys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",225001008@csu.edu.cn; 215012187@cus.edu.cn; qiliang.liu@csu.edu.cn; gushengwu@csu.edu.cn; chenkaiqi@csu.edu.cn; dengmin@csu.edu.cn; 215007008@csu.edu.cn; xiurui7@126.com,,"Chen, Kaiqi/0000-0001-7505-0764","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFB3900903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271484]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China [KT202410]; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province [HBZ20240132]","National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China; Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province","This research was funded through support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3900903), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271484), the Water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou, China (No. KT202410), and the Research Foundation of the Department of Natural Resources of Hunan Province (Grant No. HBZ20240132).",,58,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

These recommendations rely on the edges of the graph to identify suitable products. They can be improved by grouping similar products together, which results in more precise suggestions. Unlike the topology, the textual data in nodes of the Product Space graph are typically unutilized in graph clustering methods. In this context, we propose a novel approach for economic graph learning that incorporates learning node data alongside network topology. By applying this method to the Product Space dataset, we demonstrate how recommendations have been improved by presenting real-life applications.

The paper at hand introduces a novel unsupervised technique to semantically identify the position of an autonomous agent in unknown environments. When the robot explores a certain path for the first time, community detection is achieved through graph-based segmentation. This allows the agent to semantically define its surroundings in future traverses even if the environment's lighting conditions are changed. The proposed semantic clustering technique exploits the Louvain community detection algorithm, which constitutes a novel and efficient method for identifying groups of measurements with consistent similarity. The produced communities are combined with metric information, as provided by the robot's odometry through a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. The suggested algorithm is evaluated in indoors and outdoors datasets creating topological maps capable of assisting semantic localization. We demonstrate that the system categorizes the places correctly when the robot revisits an environment despite the possible lighting variation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using indoor data collected by an unmanned aerial robot (UAR) and a publicly available dataset, we apply a community detection algorithm (CDA) to find efficiently coherent visual data throughout the trajectory creating a semantic base map. Then, we optimize the formed communities using metric information by implementing an hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. The multilayer semantic map is created by constructing map instances for variant lighting conditions and matching the generated clusters to their base map correspondence. The proposed matching method relies on the graphs centrality indicators to identify central images of a region and utilize them to efficiently extract resemblances within the base map.","[Papapetros, Ioannis Tsampikos; Balaska, Vasiliki; Gasteratos, Antonios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Papapetros, IT (corresponding author), Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece.",,"Gasteratos, Antonios/AAI-4740-2021",,,,,,35,17,17,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2373-6720,,978-1-7281-4278-4,INT CONF UNMAN AIRCR,,,2020,,,,,,,1206.0,1212.0,,10.1109/icuas48674.2020.9213923,0.0,,,7,Automation & Control Systems,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,BQ6IY,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000612041300155,0,Automation & Control Systems

We extend this geometry to a hypersphere and prove that maximizing modularity is equivalent to minimizing the angular distance to some modularity vector over the set of clustering vectors. In that sense, modularity-based community detection methods can be seen as a subclass of a more general class of projection methods, which we define as the community detection methods that adhere to the following two-step procedure: first, mapping the network to a point on the hypersphere; second, projecting this point to the set of clustering vectors. We show that this class of projection methods contains many interesting community detection methods. Many of these new methods cannot be described in terms of null models and resolution parameters, as is customary for modularity-based methods. We provide a new characterization of such methods in terms of meridians and latitudes of the hypersphere. In addition, by relating the modularity resolution parameter to the latitude of the corresponding modularity vector, we obtain a new interpretation of the resolution limit that modularity maximization is known to suffer from.","[Gosgens, Martijn; van der Hofstad, Remco; Litvak, Nelly] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Litvak, Nelly] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; University of Twente,"Gösgens, M (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",RESEARCH@MARTIJNGOSGENS.NL; R.W.V.D.HOFSTAD@TUE.NL; N.LITVAK@UTWENTE.NL,"van der harst, pim/G-1993-2010",,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS [024.002.003],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work is supported in part by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Gravitation NETWORKS grant no. 024.002.003.,,60,1,1,1,2,MICROTOME PUBL,BROOKLINE,"31 GIBBS ST, BROOKLINE, MA 02446 USA",1532-4435,,,J MACH LEARN RES,J.

It merges as a new way to provide a systematic view and complementary information of COVID-19 progression in the US, enabling evidence-based responses towards pandemic intervention and prevention. To begin with, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US. Then, relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics, which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics. Lastly, the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement, community detection, and online random forest, which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic. It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer (DER) are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution. Social factors regarding the political party, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network. Moreover, the cluster-specific predictor based on online random forest and sliding window is proven useful in dynamically capturing and predicting the epidemiological trends for each community, which can reach the highest.","[Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Unwin, Juliette] MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, London, England; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Taichung 413310, Taiwan; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Theoret & Appl Informat, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Nanyang Technological University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chaoyang University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Theoretical & Applied Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg; h.unwin@imperial.ac.uk,"Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024; Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016","Unwin, Juliette/0000-0002-9120-4003","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore [04MNP000279C120, 04MNP002126C120]; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [04INS000423C120]","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University)","This study is supported by the Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore (No. 04MNP000279C120, No. 04MNP002126C120) and the Start-Up Grant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (No. 04INS000423C120) .",,58,17,17,7,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

For many of these molecules, property data have not been measured yet and need to be estimated to determine suitability to a particular application. For example, viscosity is a key property in the development of green solvents, fuel additives, and biofuels. This paper proposes the use of modularity as a molecular descriptor combined with functional group counts to estimate molecular properties using neural network models. The modularity of molecules was determined from graph representations using community detection algorithms. The potential for this approach was demonstrated for the modeling of viscosity at 25 degrees C and applied to biomass-derived molecules. The model performances showed that including modularity contributed to more accurate estimations than viscosity models existing in the literature. Furthermore, modularity on its own can be useful to estimate viscosity for n-alkanes, esters, isoalkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, and cycloalkanes. This was due to the capacity of modularity to capture the structural features of the molecules employed in the data set. As such, modularity exhibited its tremendous potential to be exploited for property estimation, supporting the screening, rational design, and engineering of green chemicals derived from biomass.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Valencia, Diego; Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero; Aburto, Jorge] Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico; [Arvizu, Cristopher; Alatorre, Diego Francisco Romero] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Chem, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Mexican Inst Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021; Aburto, Jorge/B-4600-2009","Aburto, Jorge/0000-0002-8282-6046; MARTINEZ HERNANDEZ, ELIAS/0000-0002-2789-7239; Valencia, Diego/0000-0002-2877-2841",[D.61074],,The authors would like to acknowledge Project D.61074 (IMP) for financial support.,,36,13,13,0,8,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

However, there is not enough awareness that members of a community C (either revealed or not) inside a network $G$ could act strategically to evade such tools either for legitimate (e.g., activist groups in authoritarian regimes) or malicious (e.g., terrorists) purpose. Community deception offers this possibility. By identifying a certain number of C 's member connections to be rewired, community deception algorithms can successfully hide a community that wants to stay below the radar of detection techniques. However, the state-of-the-art deception approaches have focused on networks without attributes, although real-world networks (e.g., Facebook) include attributes (e.g., age and sex) that play a central role in detecting more accurate communities. This article faces three novel challenges introduced when designing deception techniques for networks with attributes. The first concerns how to model and encode attributes most flexibly. The second is about framing attribute-aware community deception as an optimization problem. Finally, the challenge of solving the optimization problem by leveraging network topology and attributes also arises. We leverage a simple way to model network attributes as edge weights, a novel optimization function called community diffusion, and Diffuser a greedy algorithm to optimize diffusion, to solve the above challenges. We evaluated Diffuser against several community detection algorithms and compared it with state-of-the-art deception approaches on various real-world networks. From the evaluation, we can draw two main observations. First, adopting attribute-oblivious deception techniques leads to unsatisfactory results. Second, community diffusion as an optimization function specific to attributed networks is preferred to community safeness, the state-of-the-art deception optimization function, even when recasting the latter as an attribute-aware function.","[Fionda, Valeria] Univ Calabria, DeMaCS, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Pirro, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ Rome, DI, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Calabria; Sapienza University Rome,"Pirrò, G (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, DI, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",fionda@mat.unical.it; pirro@di.uniroma1.it,,"Fionda, Valeria/0000-0002-7018-1324",,,,,31,4,4,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm where multiple clients can collaboratively train a defect detection model in a privacy-preserving manner. A prevalent issue in FL, concept drift, is discussed in this article. Feature representations of the same label may vary at different clients which affects the performance of FL. To address this issue, a novel community aware personalized federated learning (CA-PFL) is proposed in this article. A graph structured federation social network is constructed with local model updates. Communities in federation network are discovered with community detection to ensure that the same label at different clients have similar representations in each community. Shared layers of local models are aggregated in each community and each local client keeps their personalized layers. Furthermore, a federation community contrastive loss (FedCCL) is proposed to accelerate training convergence by constraining the direction of local model updating. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that CA-PFL achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than state-of-the-art personalized federated learning methods in concept drifts scenarios.","[Zhao, Hongwei; Liu, Qiyuan; Sun, Haoyun; Zhang, Weishan; Zhao, Yikang] China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongwei; Liu, Qiyuan; Sun, Haoyun; Zhang, Weishan; Zhao, Yikang] Shandong Data Open Innovat Applicat Lab, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang] Beijing Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao 266114, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; University of Science & Technology Beijing; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, WS (corresponding author), China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.;Zhang, WS (corresponding author), Shandong Data Open Innovat Applicat Lab, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.",zhw@s.upc.edu.cn; upcedc670@163.com; hys_upc@163.com; xuliang.upc.edu@gmail.com; zhangws@upc.edu.cn; yikang_zhao0815@s.upc.edu.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn,"Zhang, Weishan/AAC-4520-2022; Sun, Haoyun/AAC-4369-2022","haoyun, sun/0000-0002-8326-0152; Zhang, Weishan/0000-0001-9800-1068; Zhao, Hongwei/0000-0001-5235-0748",National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072469]; Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2023MF041],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072469, in part by Shandong Data Open Innovative Application Laboratory, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2023MF041.",,57,0,0,9,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

We use ground-truth data to visualize how our measures correlate with observed patterns, thereby illustrating our method provides accurate depictions of geospatial civil war dynamics. We also evaluate the impact of several indicators highlighted by past research and our community-based spatiotemporal measures and comparing it to the preprocessed count indicator. Our findings indicate that the relationship between state capacity and climate stress show opposite correlations with civil war as those identified by studies that use count-based indicators.

Specifically, despite their appealing applications, community detection algorithms expose personal relationships that might be misused against social network members. This concern has opened a new research area called community deception, which is about hiding the members of a target community from community detection algorithms. State-of-the-art deception methods only look at how community members must perform edge updates to guarantee some level of hiding. This article introduces node-centric deception, a novel approach considering nodes entering and leaving a target community. We theoretically study the effect of node updates by leveraging node safeness as a deception optimization function. Based on this analysis, we present an effective heuristic capable of hiding the target community with minimal node operations. We evaluated our approach against several community detection algorithms and compared it with state-of-the-art deception algorithms with encouraging results.","[Madi, Saif Aldeen] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Sci, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Pirro, Giuseppe] Univ Calabria, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-87046 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Calabria,"Pirro, G (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-87046 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",madi@di.uniroma1.it; giuseppe.pirro@unical.it,"Pirrò, Giuseppe/AAF-1993-2019","Madi, Saif Aldeen/0000-0003-0336-6131; Pirro, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7499-5798",,,,,30,2,2,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Typical examples include online social net-works and ecology networks. While the identification of commu-nities bears numerous practical applications, with the increasing awareness of data security and privacy concerns, the need to protect the community affiliations of individuals from disclosing by attackers emerges. This raises the community deception (CD) problem, that is, the opposite of community detection, which asks for ways to minimally perturb the network structures by rewiring nodes so that the target communities maximally hide themself from community detection algorithms. To this end, we investigate the CD problem through a Laplacian spectrum lens and propose a method named ComDeceptor to hide a flexible target set of communities, which is more universal than most existing methods that either focus on hiding the entire communities or a single community. The key idea of ComDeceptor is to first allocate the resources of perturbations fairly and effectively. By proving that hiding communities through intercommunity edge addition and intracommunity edge deletion correspond to maximizing the second smallest eigenvalue ?(2) and minimizing the largest eigenvalue ?(n) of the graph Laplacian, respectively, ComDeceptor then incorporates efficient heuristics for approx-imately solving the problems, thus selecting the appropriate edge to perturb. Experimental results over nine real-world networks and six community detection algorithms not only demonstrate the efficiency of ComDeceptor, but also the superior performance on obfuscating community structures over the baselines.","[Zhang, Chong; Fu, Luoyi; Ding, Jiaxin; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xinde] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Long, Fei] Xinhua News Agcy, State Key Lab Media Convergence Prod Technol & Sys, Beijing 100077, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Jing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chenghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, XB (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zhangchong18@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; jiaxinding@sjtu.edu.cn; xdcao@sjtu.edu.cn; longf05@tsinghua.org.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; zhoulei1588@sjtu.edu.cn; zhangjing1010@sjtu.edu.cn; zhouch@Ireis.ac.cn,"ZHANG, JING/KHY-1073-2024; Cao, Xinde/I-7971-2015; Ding, Jiaxin/ACA-4233-2022; YANG, DAN/KCL-5217-2024; wang, wei/JYP-7819-2024; Long, Fei/ADM-0209-2022; Zhou, Lei/G-5200-2010","Zhou, Lei/0000-0002-0433-3991; Zhou, Chenghu/0000-0003-3331-2302","NSF China [42050105, 62020106005, 62061146002, 61960206002]; 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader [18XD1401800]",NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader,"This work was supported in part by the NSF China under Grant 42050105, Grant 62020106005, Grant 62061146002, and Grant 61960206002; in part by the 100-Talents Program of Xinhua News Agency; in part by the Shanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; and in part by the Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader under Grant 18XD1401800.",,37,2,2,1,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Spectral flow cytometry allows for high- dimensional analysis of immune cells, overcoming limitations of conventional flow cytometry. However, analyzing data from large Ab panels is challenging using traditional biaxial gating strategies. We present, to our knowledge, a novel analysis pipeline to improve analysis of spectral flow cytometry. We employ this method to identify rare T cell populations in aging. We isolated splenocytes from young (2-3 mo old) and aged (18-19 mo old) female C57BL/6N mice and then stained these with a panel of 20 fluorescently labeled Abs. We performed spectral flow cytometry and then data processing and analysis using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment to perform dimensionality reduction, batch correction, unsupervised clustering, and differential expression analysis. Our analysis of 3,776,804 T cells from 11 spleens revealed 35 distinct T cell clusters identified by surface marker expression. We observed significant differences between young and aged mice, with clusters enriched in one age group over the other. Naive, effector memory, and central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets exhibited age-associated changes in abundance and marker expression. We also demonstrate the utility of our pipeline in a human PBMC dataset that used a 50- fluorescent color panel. By leveraging high-dimensional analysis methods, we provide insights into the immune aging process. This approach offers a robust and easily implemented analysis pipeline for spectral flow cytometry data that may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for age-related immune dysfunction.

We present examples of the use of FlowKit for constructing reporting and analysis workflows, including round-tripping results to and from FlowJo for joint analysis by both domain and quantitative experts.","[White, Scott; Mosier, Sarah M.; Denny, Thomas N.; Weinhold, Kent J.; Ferrari, Guido; Chan, Cliburn] Duke Univ, Duke Ctr AIDS Res, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [White, Scott; Chan, Cliburn] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [White, Scott; Ferrari, Guido; Chan, Cliburn] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Syst Immunol, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Quinn, John; Almarode, James] BD Life Sci FlowJo, Ashland, OR USA; [Enzor, Jennifer; Staats, Janet; Weinhold, Kent J.] Duke Univ, Duke Immune Profiling Core, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA; [Enzor, Jennifer; Staats, Janet; Mosier, Sarah M.; Weinhold, Kent J.; Ferrari, Guido] Duke Univ, Dept Surg, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Denny, Thomas N.] Duke Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"White, S (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Duke Ctr AIDS Res, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;White, S (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;White, S (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Human Syst Immunol, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",scott.white@duke.edu,,"Weinhold, Kent/0000-0003-4876-6737","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health [HHSN272201700061C]; Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), a National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5P30 AI064518]; EQAPOL","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), a National Institutes of Health (NIH); EQAPOL","This research is supported in part through an EQAPOL collaboration with federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Contract Number HHSN272201700061C, and by the Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), a National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded program (5P30 AI064518).",,16,12,12,1,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

The disconnected picture of macrophage biology that has emerged from these observations is a barrier for integration across models or with in vitro macrophage activation paradigms. We set out to contextualize macrophage heterogeneity across mouse tissues and inflammatory conditions, specifically aiming to define a common framework of macrophage activation. We built a predictive model with which we mapped the activation of macrophages across 12 tissues and 25 biological conditions, finding a notable commonality and finite number of transcriptional profiles, in particular among infiltrating macrophages, which we modeled as defined stages along four conserved activation paths. These activation paths include a phagocytic regulatory path, an inflammatory cytokine-producing path, an oxidative stress antimicrobial path, or a remodeling extracellular matrix deposition path. We verified this model with adoptive cell transfer experiments and identified transient RELM. expression as a feature of monocyte-derived macrophage tissue engraftment. We propose that this integrative approach of macrophage classification allows the establishment of a common predictive framework of monocyte-derived macrophage activation in inflammation and homeostasis.","[Sanin, David E.;

With the influx of large-scale data sets from diverse modalities, the resolution achieved has supported the long-held notion that immune cells are naturally organized into hierarchical relationships, characterized at multiple levels. Such a multigranular structure corresponds to key geometric and topological features. Given that differences between an effective and ineffective immunological response may not be found at one level, there is vested interest in characterizing and predicting outcomes from such features. In this review, we highlight single cell methods and principles for learning geometric and topological properties of data at multiple scales, discussing their contributions to immunology.

To leverage the full potential of roadside 4D MMW radars, an innovative traffic detection method is proposed based on their distinctive data characteristics. First, velocity-based filtering and region of interest (ROI) extraction were employed to filter and associate point data by merging the point cloud frames to enhance the point relationship. Then, the Louvain algorithm was used to divide the graph into modularity by converting the point cloud data into graph structure and amplifying the differences with the Gaussian kernel function. Finally, a detection augmentation method is introduced to address the problems of over-clustering and under-clustering based on the object ID characteristics of 4D MMW radar data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method obtained the highest average precision and F1 score: 98.15% and 98.58%, respectively.

A significant challenge remains the accurate partition of fine-grained land-use units from these images. This paper presents a novel method for deriving these units based on unsupervised graph learning techniques using high-resolution satellite images and open street boundaries. Our method constructs a graph to represent spatial relations between land cover objects as graph nodes within a street block. These nodes are characterized by spatial composition and structure features of their surrounding neighborhood. We then apply unsupervised graph learning to partition the graph into subgraphs, which represent communities spatially bounded by street boundaries and correspond to land use units. Next, a graph neural network is used to extract deep structural features for land use classification. Experiments were conducted using high-resolution satellite images from the cities of Fuzhou and Quanzhou, China. Results showed that our method surpassed traditional grid and street block techniques, improving land use classification accuracy by 24% and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, it achieved classification results comparable to those using reference land use units, with an overall accuracy of 0.87 versus 0.89.","[Li, Mengmeng; Gai, Xinyi; Lou, Kangkai] Fuzhou Univ, Acad Digital China Fujian, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Stein, Alfred] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands",Fuzhou University; University of Twente,"Li, MM (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Acad Digital China Fujian, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.",mli@fzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiang Long from Fuzhou University,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiang Long from Fuzhou University,We would like to thank Jiang Long from Fuzhou University for the support on the experimental analysis.,,63,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8947,1753-8955,,INT J DIGIT EARTH,Int.

Moreover, the research adapts two popular network community detection methods to account for spatial constraints for defining HSAs that are scale flexible and optimize an important property such as maximum service flows within HSAs. A case study based on the state inpatient database in Florida from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project is used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods.

The central flow theory suggests that the mega-city regions are formed by the interconnected flows of people across cities, making the spatial synergy can be measured by assessing the aggregation and intensity of flows and interactions between cities and regions. Human mobility data, such as mobile phone data and social media check-ins, enable the tracking of human movements, thus facilitating the transition of central flow theory from theoretical constructs to empirical research. To this end, this study presents an alternative data-driven framework to reveal the multi-scale spatial synergy of mega-city regions from a human mobility perspective. It uncovers homogeneously spatial communities with high inter-city integration using community detection. Strong internal spatial connections of 2.13 billion mobility are filtered using network backbone extraction. An experiment in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, demonstrates a multi-scale and multi-core hierarchical spatial synergy in the PRD region. The detailed findings are as follows: (1) Three cities attract the majority of human mobility. Mobility distance is short in urban centers and long in suburban areas. (2) The spatial integration pattern shows the detected communities reveal the hierarchical integration pattern with three main integrated regions: Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing, Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou, and Zhuhai-Zhongshan-Jiangmen. (3) The spatial connection pattern illustrates the close ties of 9 cities and three core cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan. These results provide a human-centric understanding of urban synergy and deeper insights into central flow theory, which supports cooperative development in mega-city regions.","[Fang, Bichen; Li, Mingxiao; Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Fang, Bichen; Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Dept Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Mingxiao; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei] Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Mingxiao; Huang, Zhengdong; Tu, Wei; Guo, Renzhong] Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Smart Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhengdong; Yue, Yang; Tu, Wei] State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg & Urban Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Guo, Renzhong] MNR, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Great Bay Area, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University,"Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urban Informat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Li, MX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Smart Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",limx@szu.edu.cn,"Li, Mingxiao/ISU-6660-2023; TU, Wei/H-4073-2014","Li, Mingxiao/0000-0003-0779-4432; Yue, Yang/0000-0001-6934-2357; Fang, Bichen/0009-0004-5415-6251","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071360, 42311530335, 42101463]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB2103104]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20220818100200001, ZDSYS20210623101800001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program,"This study is supported and funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 42071360, 42311530335, and 42101463]; National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2019YFB2103104]; and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [grant number JCYJ20220818100200001, ZDSYS20210623101800001].",,55,1,1,47,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1009-5020,1993-5153,,GEO-SPAT INF SCI,Geo-Spat.

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.","[Liu, Qiliang; Hou, Zhaoyi; Yang, Jie] Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jie_yang@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41971353, 41730105]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ20058, 2020JJ4695]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province [KT202110, KT202002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded through support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 41971353 and 41730105), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2021JJ20058 and 2020JJ4695), and the water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province (No. KT202110 and KT202002).",,43,1,1,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4144,10.3390/rs14174144,0.0,,,20,Remote Sensing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4K1ZE,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000851756200001,0,Remote Sensing

The composition of these editorial boards is explored in terms of geographic affiliation, institutional affiliation, and gender. Results highlight that the academic publishing environment is primarily governed by men affiliated with elite universities in the United States. The study further explores social similarities among journals using a network analysis perspective based on interlocking editorship. Comparison of networks generated by all scholars, editorial leaders, and non-editorial leaders reveals significant structural similarities and associations among clusters of journals. These results indicate that links between pairs of journals tend to be redundant, and this can be interpreted in terms of social and intellectual homophily within each board, and between boards of journals belonging to the same cluster. Finally, the analysis of the most central journals and scholars in the networks suggests that journals probably adopt 'strategic decisions' in the selection of the editorial board members. The documented high concentration of editorial power poses a serious risk to innovative research in economics.","[Baccini, Alberto; Re, Cristina] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Baccini, A (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Siena, Italy.",cristina.re@uniupo.it,"Baccini, Alberto/B-3578-2010","Re, Cristina/0000-0001-7715-8250; Baccini, Alberto/0000-0003-0293-482X","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (PRIN) [2017MPXW98]","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","The research funded by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (PRIN project 2017MPXW98).",,42,3,3,2,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-8259,1465-3982,,REV POLIT ECON,Rev.

Existing pandemic control methods, such as lockdowns, greatly affect residents' normal lives. This paper pro-poses a pandemic control method, consisting of the scientific delineation of urban areas based on multimodal transportation data. An improved Leiden method based on the gravity model is used to construct a preliminary zoning scheme, which is then modified by spatial constraints. The modularity index demonstrates the suitability of this method for community detection. This method can minimize cut-off traffic flows between pandemic control areas. The results show that only 24.8% of travel links are disrupted using our method, which could reduce both the impact of pandemic control on the daily life of residents and its cost. These findings can help develop sustainable strategies and proposals for effective pandemic response.","[Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban T, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Hua, Mingzhuang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Gen Aviat & Flight, Liyang 213300, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuewu] Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Chen, XW (corresponding author), Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",chenxuewu@seu.edu.cn,"Hua, Mingzhuang/GRJ-5095-2022; Yufei, Wang/KFQ-7799-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52172316],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is sponsored by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (52172316) .

These spatial flows are for crude petroleum, gasoline, and oil fuels. The analysis shows that all three fuels have different network topology. For all six networks we find major hubs of crude petroleum and its products, gasoline and fuel oils, concentrated in areas with large reserves such as the south-central part of the US. Using modularity, a network cluster identification metric, we show that spatial interactions can be used to delineate functional regions and their differences across fuel types. These functional regions evolve over time in response to the shifting US role as a major producer and net exporter of fossil fuels, expansion of the domestic pipeline network, and increases in fuel production and refinement locations. The modal split of the fuels examined in this paper shows the dominant role pipelines play for crude petroleum, transporting approximately 83 % of tonnage in 2017 and increasing to almost 89 % in 2022. In contrast, gasoline and oil fuels modal split hovers at around 60 % of tonnage transported by tanker truck followed by other modes including pipelines. Our analysis shows geographic clustering of major hubs and their functional regions along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana. These are in places that are often the locations of natural disasters. This together with the rapid increase of a few hubs as gateways to fossil fuel US exports makes them prime candidates in disrupting fossil fuel supply chains worldwide and amplifies vulnerability of fossil fuel supply chains. The spatial clustering trends shown in this paper provide added evidence of the source of short-term negative impacts in places such as Chicago in Illinois and Corpus Christi in Texas. This offers added information for government intervention.","[Goulias, Konstadinos G.; Shi, Hui] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Goulias, KG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",kgoulias@UCSB.edu,"Shi, Hui/LZE-8238-2025",,,,,,68,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Commuting patterns are highly linked to the spatial structure of functional districts in a city, which is substantially influenced by public transportation systems. Understanding urban mobility patterns are significant for revealing actual living districts and planning efficient transportation systems and infrastructure. This study aims to detect urban communities with spatially strong interaction based on similar mobility patterns. To extract homogeneous urban communities, we utilize a network community detection method, focusing on the multimodal transfer travels of the public transport system. As a case study, we examined urban communities in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea. The results showed newly detected living communities based on the actual mobility patterns of urban populations including multiple-choice behavior of transport mode.

The contradictions between the goals and the concrete plans to increase production, processing, and consumption of forest biomass in Europe have however raised sustainability concerns within and beyond its borders. While political actors articulate such contradictions differently and compete for traction for their viewpoints in the public discourse, little is known about how citizens of urban areas perceive this discourse. Conceptualising perception as a multidimensional construct, data from eight European university cities (Bordeaux, Bratislava, Freiburg, Helsinki, Padua, St. Petersburg, Uppsala, Vienna) are statistically analysed to explore its dimensions, the communities of like-minded citizens forming across those dimensions, and the traits associating with membership in each such community. Five communities across six dimensions from biocentrism through distributional aspects to adherence to political goals are identified: adherent-environmentalist, adherent-governmentalist, critical-reformist, critical -agriculturalist, and indifferent. City of residence and perceived familiarity with bioeconomy clearly interact with perception.

Much of the within-community variation remains unexplained, though, calling for more work locally.

Generative generic-field design can solve more general design problems innovatively by integrating multi-domain design knowledge. However, there is a lack of knowledge representation and design process model in line with the design cognition of the new context. It is urgent to develop generative generic-field design methods to improve the feasibility, innovation, and empathy of design results. This study proposes a method based on design cognition and knowledge reasoning. Firstly, through the problem formulation, a generative universal domain design framework and knowledge base are constructed. Secondly, the knowledge-based discrete physical structure set generation method and system architecture generation method are proposed. Finally, the application tool Intelligent Design Assistant (IDA) is developed, verified, and discussed through an engineering design case. According to the design results and discussion, the design scheme is feasible and reflects empathy for the fuzzy original design requirements.

As an important key mineral, copper is widely used in the national economic construction and defense industry. This leads to fierce competition and a complex flow relationship between copper resource trading countries. Based on the perspective of the industrial chain, this paper constructs a model of the copper resource trade evolution network and trade competition network from 2001 to 2020 and analyzes the temporal, spatial evolution, and competitive characteristics of trade. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Since 2001, the global trade of copper resources has fluctuated greatly, trade competition is very intense, and the demand for copper has continued to increase. Copper ore is the most important trade, followed by refined copper, copper product, waste copper, and blister copper. (2) Copper resources have different characteristics at different stages of the industrial chain. Refined copper trade relations are the most concentrated. The copper product trade is the most stable. Community division presents different characteristics. (3) Trade relations and trade volume are highly concentrated in a few countries, and competition is unevenly distributed. Competitive relations are mainly concentrated in European and Asian countries, within Asian countries or European countries. (4) The Asia-Pacific region has reached a dominant position in the copper resource competition pattern, especially between China and Japan. Finally, this article provides some suggestions to maintain the stability of the copper resource trade and improve the ability to resist risks for China.","[Kang, Xinyu; Wang, Minxi; Wang, Taixin; Luo, Fanjie; Lin, Jing; Li, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Technology,"Wang, MX; Luo, FJ; Li, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",kangxinyu@stu.cdut.edu.cn; wangminxi@mail.cdut.edu.cn; wangtaixin@stu.cdut.edu.cn; luofanjie@stu.cdut.edu.cn; jeanreen@stu.cdut.edu.cn; lixin2012@cdut.cn,"; Jing, Lin/JNS-7112-2023","li, xin/0000-0002-2939-4811; Jing, Lin/0000-0003-2137-1655",Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology; [YJ2021-XP004],Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology;,Funding This research was supported by Philosophy and Social Science Research Fund of Chengdu University of Technology (YJ2021-XP004) .,,49,17,17,24,167,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

To extract migration events, we use the child ladder approach, which traces family moves based on changes in birthplaces of consecutive children in each individual family. We calculate a time series measure of migration rate and partition the time into optimal periods so that each period has a distinct migration network. We apply community detection to derive migration regions from each network of different periods. We map these regions and use a pair-counting measure to statistically compare the similarity of regions in consecutive time periods. Migration regions reveal the extent to which the strong regional identities we see today, and, in the past, which were rooted in migration. The North/South divide was pervasive not only in the early periods but throughout U.S. history. Migration regions are important for understanding the development of regional and national cultural forms such as music, literature, foodways, and dialects, as well as political divisions and events.","[Koylu, Caglar; Torkashvand, Maryam; Kwon, Hoeyun] Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kasakoff, Alice Bee] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC USA",University of Iowa; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Koylu, C (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",caglar-koylu@uiowa.edu,"Koylu, Caglar/G-3406-2013",,National Science Foundation (NSF) [2215568],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by The National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant No. 2215568 titled Population-scale kinship networks and migration.,,20,0,0,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9533-5,,,,2022,,,,,,,24.0,27,,10.1145/3557919.3565814,0.0,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Computer Science; Physical Geography,BW5ZC,,Bronze,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001169954700004,0,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary"

This is a first systematic stylometric study on this problem and a baroque hispanoamerican text. In our study, we faced building a balanced corpus from few available resources, and took extensive evaluation measures to deal with unclear stylometric signals. We use a variety of established attribution and verification methods, and introduce a novel evaluation procedure of examining historic texts with scarce corpora. The results support Sor Juana's authorship, and unravel new connections between her and other authors of the time, showing, still undermined, powerful impact of her works on the epoch.

Administrative matters depict a more egalitarian distribution.

Finally, by exploiting both automatic linking and manual interventions in the visualization platform, an iterative, semi-automatic structuring pipeline is proposed to solve difficult cases missed by automatic structuring, and then improve structuring optimally.

Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well-performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A PYTHON implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for PYTHON.","[Aref, Samin; Chheda, Hriday] Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8, Canada; [Mostajabdaveh, Mahdi] Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Toronto; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Aref, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8, Canada.",aref@mie.utoronto.ca,Mostajabdaveh/AAJ-4900-2020,"Aref, Samin/0000-0002-5870-9253",Data Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto,Data Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto,"The authors acknowledge Sanchaai Mathiyarasan for technical assistance and Giulio Rossetti, Remy Cazabet, Pawel Pralat, and Tiago P.

Suitably conducted community detection reveals various embedded informative substructures of network topology. However, regarding the practical usage of community detection, it has always been a tricky problem to assign a reasonable community resolution for networks of interest. Because of the absence of the unanimously accepted criterion, most of the previous studies utilized rather ad hoc heuristics to decide the community resolution. In this work, we harness the concept of consistency in community structures of networks to provide the overall community resolution landscape of networks, which we eventually take to quantify the reliability of detected communities for a given resolution parameter. More precisely, we exploit the ambiguity in the results of stochastic detection algorithms and suggest a method that denotes the relative validity of community structures in regard to their stability of global and local inconsistency measures using multiple detection processes. Applying our framework to synthetic and real networks, we confirm that it effectively displays insightful fundamental aspects of community structures.","[Lee, Daekyung; Kim, Beom Jun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hoon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea; [Kim, Heetae] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Liberal Arts, Jinju 52725, South Korea.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Future Convergence Technol Res Inst, Jinju 52849, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Korea Inst Energy Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Naju 58322, South Korea.;Kim, H (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Engn, Data Sci Inst, Santiago 7610658, Chile.",lshlj82@gnu.ac.kr; kimheetae@gmail.com,"Kim, Heetae/S-3876-2019","Lee, Sang Hoon/0000-0003-3079-5679; Kim, Heetae/0000-0002-5688-2626","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [20194010000290]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2018R1C1B5083863, NRF-2021R1C1C1004132]; National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT [11190096]","Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of KoreaKorea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation & Planning (KETEP)); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT","D.L. and B.J.K. were supported by Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), granted financial resource from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea (Grant No. 20194010000290), S.H.L. was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea Grants No. NRF-2018R1C1B5083863 and No. NRF-2021R1C1C1004132, and H.K. was supported by the National Agency of Investigation and Development of Chile, ANID, through the grant FONDECYT No. 11190096.",,31,10,10,1,11,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",2470-0045,2470-0053,,PHYS REV E,Phys.

Unfortunately, such models fail to describe all those systems in which building blocks interact at a higher order. Higher-order graphs provide us the right tools for the task, but introduce a higher computing complexity due to the interaction order. In this paper we analyze the interplay between the structure of a directed hypergraph and a linear dynamical system, a random walk, defined on it. How can one extend network measures, such as centrality or modularity, to this framework? Instead of redefining network measures through the hypergraph framework, with the consequent complexity boost, we will measure the dynamical system associated to it. This approach let us apply known measures to pairwise structures, such as the transition matrix, and determine a family of measures that are amenable to such a procedure.","[Faccin, Mauro] Univ Paris, Inst Rech Dev IRD, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Faccin, Mauro] Univ Paris, Ctr Populat & Dev CEPED, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite,"Faccin, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Inst Rech Dev IRD, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.;Faccin, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Ctr Populat & Dev CEPED, Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",,,"faccin, mauro/0000-0003-0706-3007",National French Agencies ANR [TRACTRUST-ANR-20-COVI-0102]; ANRS [MEDIACAM-ANRS COV24],National French Agencies ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANRS(ANRSAgence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),M.F. thanks Michael T.

As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.","[Jerdee, Maximilian; Newman, M.

J,"Tian, MY; Moriano, P",,,,"Tian, Moyi; Moriano, Pablo",,,Robustness of community structure under edge addition,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPLEX NETWORKS; ERROR,"Communities often represent key structural , functional clusters in networks. To preserve such communi-ties, it is important to understand their robustness under network perturbations. Previous work in community robustness analysis has focused on studying changes in the community structure as a response of edge rewiring and node or edge removal. However, the impact of increasing connectivity on the robustness of communities in networked systems is relatively unexplored. Studying the limits of community robustness under edge addition is crucial to better understanding the cases in which density expands or false edges erroneously appear. In this paper, we analyze the effect of edge addition on community robustness in synthetic and empirical temporal networks. We study two scenarios of edge addition: random and targeted. We use four community detection algorithms, Infomap, Label Propagation, Leiden , Louvain, and demonstrate the results in community similarity metrics. The experiments on synthetic networks show that communities are more robust when the initial partition is stronger or the edge addition is random, and the experiments on empirical data also indicate that robustness performance can be affected by the community similarity metric. Overall, our results suggest that the communities identified by the different types of community detection algorithms exhibit different levels of robustness, and so the robustness of communities depends strongly on the choice of detection method.","[Tian, Moyi] Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Moriano, Pablo] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Comp Sci & Math Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",Brown University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Tian, MY (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",moyi_tian@brown.edu; moriano@ornl.gov,"; Moriano, Pablo/AAC-6334-2021","Tian, Moyi/0000-0001-8166-7410; Moriano, Pablo/0000-0002-1822-8885",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program,"This paper has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

Cell types consist of hierarchical structures that perform functions differently. Constructing a hierarchical structure of cell types is crucial for revealing relationships between cell types. Existing hierarchical methods construct cell type hierarchy with fixed branches which cannot reflect actual cell type hierarchy, and cannot adapt to large-scale unlabeled data. To fill the gap, we propose scHSD, a hierarchical structure detecting method which allows construct cell type hierarchy that closely actual structures, and is capable of handling large-scale data. scHSD first constructs a cell-cell similarity graph and conducts coarse-graining to minimize graph size. Then, scHSD leverages structural entropy minimization on the coarse-grained graph to build cell type hierarchy. scHSD adjusts hierarchy height and the number of branches during structural entropy minimization. To validate the method's effectiveness, we conduct experiments on datasets of different scales and compared the hierarchical structure with known cell type hierarchy. The experimental results demonstrate that our method accurately construct cell type hierarchy and can be used for cell clustering and classification.

However, most graph clustering algorithms just consider low-order topological connectivity, which limits their accuracy in gene module identification. In this study, we propose a novel network-based method, MultiSimNeNc, to identify modules in various types of networks by integrating network representation learning (NRL) and clustering algorithms. In this method, we first obtain the multi-order similarity of the network using graph convolution (GC). Then, we aggregate the multi-order similarity to characterize the network structure and use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to achieve low-dimensional node characterization. Finally, we predict the number of modules based on the bayesian information criterion (BIC) and use the gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify modules. To testify to the efficacy of MultiSimeNc in module identification, we apply this method to two types of biological networks and six benchmark networks, where the biological networks are constructed based on the fusion of multi-omics data from glioblastoma (GBM). The analysis shows that MultiSimNeNc outperforms several state-of-the-art module identification algorithms in identification accuracy, which is an effective method for understanding biomolecular mechanisms of pathogenesis from a module-level perspective.","[Wu, Hao; Liang, Biting; Zhang, Hongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhongli] Peoples Govt Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Shandong University,"Wu, H; Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",haowu@sdu.edu.cn; zhm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Zhang, Hongming/ABF-8690-2021; Li, zhuangzhuang/JAD-1371-2023; Wu, Hao/AGE-4639-2022","Wu, Hao/0000-0003-2340-9258","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972322, 62272278]; Natural Key Research and Development Program, China [2021YFF0704103]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Key Research and Development Program, China; Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China","Funding The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61972322 & 62272278) , and by the Natural Key Research and Development Program, China (Grant No. 2021YFF0704103) , and by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shan-dong University, China.

Clustering algorithms play an important role in finding these groups accurately and at scale. We set out to analyze the fitness of commonly used, fast and scalable clustering algorithms for IBD mapping applications. We designed a realistic benchmark for local IBD graphs and utilized it to compare the statistical power of clustering algorithms via simulating 2.3 million clusters across 850 experiments. We found Infomap and Markov Clustering (MCL) community detection methods to have high statistical power in most of the scenarios. They yield a 30% increase in power compared to the current state-of-art approach, with a 3 orders of magnitude lower runtime. We also found that standard clustering metrics, such as modularity, cannot predict statistical power of algorithms in IBD mapping applications. We extend our findings to real datasets by analyzing the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study dataset with 51,000 samples and 2 million shared segments on Chromosome 1, resulting in the extraction of 39 million local IBD clusters. We demonstrate the power of our approach by recovering signals of rare genetic variation in the Whole-Exome Sequence data of 200,000 individuals in the UK Biobank. We provide an efficient implementation to enable clustering at scale for IBD mapping for various populations and scenarios.

There is a lack of comprehensive and factual data-based analyses of e-scooter crashes and their causes. We collected 1936 crash-related reports over two years via the German press portal based on a systematic web content mining process. Sentiment analysis results revealed that the police reports' coverage is predominantly factual and neutral and, therefore, useful for keyword-based analyses. After identifying the 46 most relevant keywords in the reports, we generated an adjacency matrix to investigate the keywords' dependencies, visualized the network and dependencies of the most relevant keywords, and categorized them into four thematic clusters using the Louvain algorithm. Our results and findings reveal that driving under drug influence, especially alcohol, is one serious problem. Riding e-scooter in pairs and on forbidden terrain or in the wrong direction are also common causes of crashes. Consequences for e-scooter riders are severe injuries, driving license revocation, fines, criminal charges, and incurring for property damage. Further, wearing protective gear and helmets is of low acceptance among the e-scooter ridership. Based on our results and findings, we recommend e-scooter bans during the night times for some locations, obligatory driving tests before first e-scooter use, and helmet wearing.","[Brauner, Tim; Heumann, Maximilian; Kraschewski, Tobias; Prahlow, Oliver; Rehse, Jan; Kiehne, Christian; Breitner, Michael H.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Brauner, T (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",brauner@iwi.uni-hannover.de,"; Heumann, Maximilian/JVN-5695-2024","Breitner, Michael/0000-0001-7315-3022; Brauner, Tim/0000-0003-3260-5015; Heumann, Maximilian/0000-0002-3765-7423",,,,,57,11,11,1,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0001-4575,1879-2057,,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,Accid.

This paper derives the best-fitting distance decay function to capture the spatial behaviors of cancer patients in the Northeast region of the U.S., and examines and explains the spatial variability of such behaviors across sub-regions. Principal results: (1) 46.8%, 85.5%, and 99.6% of cancer care received was within a driving time of 30, 60, and 180 min, respectively. (2) The exponential distance decay function is the best in capturing the travel behavior of cancer patients in the region and across most sub-regions. (3) The friction coefficient in the distance decay function is negatively correlated with the mean travel time. (4) The best-fitting function forms are associated with network structures. (5) The variation of the friction coefficient across sub-regions is related to factors such as urbanicity, economic development level, and market competition intensity. Major conclusions: The distance decay function offers an analytic metric to capture a full spectrum of travel behavior, and thus a more comprehensive measure than average travel time. Examining the geographic variation of travel behavior needs a reliable analysis unit such as organically defined cancer service areas, which capture relevant health care market structure and thus are more meaningful than commonly-used geopolitical or census area units.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Onega, Tracy] Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,"Wang, Fahui/H-4302-2013; Wang, Changzhen/HPH-2043-2023","Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168; Wang, Fahui/0000-0001-7765-3024",,,,,55,18,20,5,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-367X,2214-3688,,TRAVEL BEHAV SOC,Travel Behav.

In this article we present a novel approach to partition road networks through network modularity to produce data-driven static traffic assignment models from loop detector data on large road systems. The use of partitioning allows the estimation of the key model input of Origin-Destination demand matrices from flow counts alone. Previous network tomography-based demand estimation techniques have been limited by the network size. The amount of partitioning changes the Origin-Destination estimation optimisation problems to different levels of computational difficulty. Different approaches to utilising the partitioning were tested, one which degenerated the road network to the scale of the partitions and others which left the network intact. Applied to a subnetwork of England's Strategic Road Network and other test networks, our results for the degenerate case showed flow and travel time errors are reasonable with a small amount of degeneration. The results for the non-degenerate cases showed that similar errors in model prediction with lower computation requirements can be obtained when using large partitions compared with the non-partitioned case. This work could be used to improve the effectiveness of national road systems planning and infrastructure models.","[Roocroft, Alexander; Punzo, Giuliano] Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England; [Roocroft, Alexander; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore",University of Sheffield; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC),"Roocroft, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England.;Roocroft, A (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore.",aroocroft1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Ramli, Muhamad/AAE-2157-2019","Roocroft, Alexander/0000-0002-6551-1800; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar/0000-0002-6321-0828","The authors would like to express their thanks to the University of Sheffield and the Agency for Science, Technology amp; Research (A*STAR) under the A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP) for funding this project.

These spatial flows are for crude petroleum, gasoline, and oil fuels. The analysis shows that all three fuels have different network topology. For all six networks we find major hubs of crude petroleum and its products, gasoline and fuel oils, concentrated in areas with large reserves such as the south-central part of the US. Using modularity, a network cluster identification metric, we show that spatial interactions can be used to delineate functional regions and their differences across fuel types. These functional regions evolve over time in response to the shifting US role as a major producer and net exporter of fossil fuels, expansion of the domestic pipeline network, and increases in fuel production and refinement locations. The modal split of the fuels examined in this paper shows the dominant role pipelines play for crude petroleum, transporting approximately 83 % of tonnage in 2017 and increasing to almost 89 % in 2022. In contrast, gasoline and oil fuels modal split hovers at around 60 % of tonnage transported by tanker truck followed by other modes including pipelines. Our analysis shows geographic clustering of major hubs and their functional regions along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana. These are in places that are often the locations of natural disasters. This together with the rapid increase of a few hubs as gateways to fossil fuel US exports makes them prime candidates in disrupting fossil fuel supply chains worldwide and amplifies vulnerability of fossil fuel supply chains. The spatial clustering trends shown in this paper provide added evidence of the source of short-term negative impacts in places such as Chicago in Illinois and Corpus Christi in Texas. This offers added information for government intervention.","[Goulias, Konstadinos G.; Shi, Hui] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Goulias, KG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog & GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",kgoulias@UCSB.edu,"Shi, Hui/LZE-8238-2025",,,,,,68,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Existing pandemic control methods, such as lockdowns, greatly affect residents' normal lives. This paper pro-poses a pandemic control method, consisting of the scientific delineation of urban areas based on multimodal transportation data. An improved Leiden method based on the gravity model is used to construct a preliminary zoning scheme, which is then modified by spatial constraints. The modularity index demonstrates the suitability of this method for community detection. This method can minimize cut-off traffic flows between pandemic control areas. The results show that only 24.8% of travel links are disrupted using our method, which could reduce both the impact of pandemic control on the daily life of residents and its cost. These findings can help develop sustainable strategies and proposals for effective pandemic response.","[Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban T, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yufei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Wendong] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Hua, Mingzhuang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Gen Aviat & Flight, Liyang 213300, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuewu] Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Chen, XW (corresponding author), Si Pai Lou 2, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",chenxuewu@seu.edu.cn,"Hua, Mingzhuang/GRJ-5095-2022; Yufei, Wang/KFQ-7799-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52172316],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is sponsored by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (52172316) .

We report that the hallmarks of tumor recognition in ovarian cancer-infiltrating T cells are primarily restricted to tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells. Single-cell RNA/TCR/ATAC sequencing of 83,454 CD3(+) CD8(+)CD103(+)CD69(+) TRM cells and immunohistochemistry of 122 high-grade serous ovarian cancers shows that only progenitor (TCF1(low)) tissue-resident T cells (TRMstem cells), but not recirculating TCF1(+) T cells, predict ovarian cancer outcome. TRMstem cells arise from transitional recirculating T cells, which depends on antigen affinity/persistence, resulting in oligoclonal, trogocytic, effector lymphocytes that eventually become exhausted. Therefore, ovarian cancer is indeed an immunogenic disease, but that depends on similar to 13% of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating T cells (similar to 3% of CD8(+) clonotypes), which are primed against high-affinity antigens and maintain waves of effector TRM-like cells.

In this review, we provide an overview of the major principles of single-cell and conventional (bulk) RNA-seq applied to onco-immunology. We describe standard preprocessing and statistical analyses of data obtained from such techniques and highlight some computational challenges relative to the sequencing of individual cells. We notably provide examples of gene expression analyses such as differential expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering and enrichment analysis. Additionally, we used public data sets to exemplify how deconvolution algorithms can identify and quantify multiple immune subpopulations from either bulk or single-cell RNAseq. We give examples of machine and deep learning models used to predict patient outcomes and treatment effect from high-dimensional data. Finally, we balance the strengths and weaknesses of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq regarding their applications in the clinic. & ordf; 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to delin-eate and characterize the cancer service areas (CSA) accounting for the presence of major cancer centers in the United States. We used the Medi-care enrollment and claims from January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015 to build a spatial network from patients with cancer to cancer care facil-ities that provided inpatient and outpatient care of cancer-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. After excluding those without clinical care or outside of the United States, we identified 94 NCI-designated and other academic cancer centers from the members of the Association of American Cancer Institutes. By explicitly incorporating existing specialized cancer referral centers, we refined the spatially constrained Leiden method that accounted for spatial adjacency and other constraints to delineate coherent CSAs within which the service volumes were maximal but minimal be-tween them. The derived 110 CSAs had a high mean localization index (LI; 0.83) with a narrow variability (SD = 0.10). The variation of LI across the CSAs was positively associated with population, median household income, and area size, and negatively with travel time. Averagely, patients traveled less and were more likely to receive cancer care within the CSAs anchored by cancer centers than their counterparts without cancer centers. We con-cluded that CSAs are effective in capturing the local cancer care markets in the United States. They can be used as reliable units for studying cancer care and informing more evidence-based policy.Significance: Using the most refined network community detection method, we can delineate CSAs in a more robust, systematic, and empirical manner that incorporates existing specialized cancer referral centers. The CSAs can be used as a reliable unit for studying cancer care and informing more evidence-based policy in the United States. The cross-walk tabula-tion of ZIP code areas, CSAs, and related programs for CSAs delineation are disseminated for public access.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Onega, Tracy] Univ Utah, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Onega, Tracy] Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Onega, Tracy] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biomed Data Sci, 1 Med Ctr Dr,HB 7927,Rubin,8th Floor, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute; Dartmouth College,"Onega, T (corresponding author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biomed Data Sci, 1 Med Ctr Dr,HB 7927,Rubin,8th Floor, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA.",tracy.onega@hci.utah.edu,"Wang, Changzhen/HPH-2043-2023","Onega, Tracy/0000-0002-1633-3040; Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",NCI [R21CA212687],NCI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"Acknowledgments This work receives financial support from the NCI (R21CA212687, T.

Multiplex imaging is a technique that can quantify the expression of multiple protein markers on the same tissue section while maintaining spatial positioning, and this method has been rapidly developed in cancer research in recent years. Many multiplex imaging technologies and spatial analysis methods are emerging, and the elucidation of their principles and features is essential.

Thus, to improve clinical care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we explored the role of age-related p16 epimutation in intestinal tumorigenesis.MethodsWe established a mouse model that replicates two common genetic and epigenetic events observed in human CRCs: Apc mutation and p16 epimutation. We conducted long-term survival and histological analysis of tumor development and progression. Colonic epithelial cells and tumors were collected from mice and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating immune cells throughout tumor progression. We tested whether anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy affects overall survival of tumor-bearing mice and whether inhibition of both epigenetic regulation and immune checkpoint is more efficacious.ResultsMice carrying combined Apc mutation and p16 epimutation had significantly shortened survival and increased tumor growth compared to those with Apc mutation only. Intriguingly, colon tumors with p16 epimutation exhibited an activated interferon pathway, increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (Pdl1), and enhanced infiltration of immune cells. scRNA-seq further revealed the presence of Foxp3(+) Tregs and gamma delta T17 cells, which contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using an inhibitor of DNA methylation and a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor is more effective for improving survival in tumor-bearing mice than blockade of either pathway alone.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that age-dependent p16 epimutation creates a permissive microenvironment for malignant transformation of polyps to colon cancer. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for future targeted therapy in patients with p16 epimutation.","[Yang, Li; Chen, Xiaomin; Lawrence, Emily B.; Shen, Lanlan] USDA, Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Childrens Nutr Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77065 USA; [Lee, Christy; Li, Jingyi Jessica] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shi, Jiejun; Cui, Ya; Li, Wei] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Div Computat Biomed, Irvine, CA USA; [Shi, Jiejun] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Tongji Hosp, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Dept Gen Surg, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lanjing] Med Ctr Princeton, Dept Pathol, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Zhang, Lanjing] Rutgers State Univ, Earnest Mario Sch Pharm, Dept Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Li, Yumei; Creighton, Chad J.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Gao, Nan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ USA; [Jung, Sung Yun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Houston, TX USA; [Creighton, Chad J.; Arimura, Sumimasa] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX USA; [Creighton, Chad J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dan Duncan Comprehens Canc Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Arimura, Sumimasa] Baylor Coll Med, Sect Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Houston, TX USA; [Lei, Yunping] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Precis Environm Hlth, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Baylor College of Medicine; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Tongji University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Baylor College of Medicine; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine,"Shen, LL (corresponding author), USDA, Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Childrens Nutr Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77065 USA.",Lanlan.Shen@bcm.edu,"Zhang, Lanjing/AGY-7838-2022; Shi, Jiejun/LXB-3187-2024; Li, Jingyi Jessica/I-2779-2019; Lei, Yunping/LMM-9159-2024; lifeng, yang/AAD-6519-2021; Li, Wei/AFW-2599-2022; ARIMURA, SUMIMASA/IQT-4772-2023; Chen, Xiaomin/AAJ-3021-2020; Zhang, Lanjing/D-1544-2009","Zhang, Lanjing/0000-0001-5436-887X; Shen, Lanlan/0000-0002-1532-5807; Shi, Jiejun/0000-0001-9777-1183","US Department of Agriculture [CRIS 3092-51000-060]; National Institutes of Health [R21CA229727, R01HD100914, R01CA233472]",US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This research was supported by grants from US Department of Agriculture (CRIS 3092-51000-060 to L.S.) and National Institutes of Health (R21CA229727, R01HD100914, and R01CA233472 to L.S.).",,70,7,7,2,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1756-9966,,J EXP CLIN CANC RES,J.

A significant challenge remains the accurate partition of fine-grained land-use units from these images. This paper presents a novel method for deriving these units based on unsupervised graph learning techniques using high-resolution satellite images and open street boundaries. Our method constructs a graph to represent spatial relations between land cover objects as graph nodes within a street block. These nodes are characterized by spatial composition and structure features of their surrounding neighborhood. We then apply unsupervised graph learning to partition the graph into subgraphs, which represent communities spatially bounded by street boundaries and correspond to land use units. Next, a graph neural network is used to extract deep structural features for land use classification. Experiments were conducted using high-resolution satellite images from the cities of Fuzhou and Quanzhou, China. Results showed that our method surpassed traditional grid and street block techniques, improving land use classification accuracy by 24% and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, it achieved classification results comparable to those using reference land use units, with an overall accuracy of 0.87 versus 0.89.","[Li, Mengmeng; Gai, Xinyi; Lou, Kangkai] Fuzhou Univ, Acad Digital China Fujian, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Stein, Alfred] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands",Fuzhou University; University of Twente,"Li, MM (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Acad Digital China Fujian, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.",mli@fzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiang Long from Fuzhou University,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiang Long from Fuzhou University,We would like to thank Jiang Long from Fuzhou University for the support on the experimental analysis.,,63,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8947,1753-8955,,INT J DIGIT EARTH,Int.

However, many studies question the replicability and reliability of the Dartmouth HSAs in meeting the challenges of an ever-changing and a diverse set of health care services. This research develops a reproducible, automated, and efficient GIS tool to implement Dartmouth method for defining HSAs. Moreover, the research adapts two popular network community detection methods to account for spatial constraints for defining HSAs that are scale flexible and optimize an important property such as maximum service flows within HSAs. A case study based on the state inpatient database in Florida from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project is used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods. The study represents a major step towards developing HSA delineation methods that are computationally efficient, adaptable for various scales (from a local region to as large as a national market) and automated without a steep learning curve for public health professionals.","[Wang, Changzhen; Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Wang, Fahui] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Wang, FH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",fwang@lsu.edu,"Wang, Changzhen/HPH-2043-2023","Wang, Changzhen/0000-0002-3065-1168",National Cancer Institute; [R21CA212687],National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI));,This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute [R21CA212687].,,39,14,16,4,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5683,1947-5691,,ANN GIS,Ann.

In recent years, spatial community detection has attracted extensive research in the field of geographic information science. However, mining the community structures and their evolutionary patterns from spatial interaction data remains challenging. Most existing methods for spatial community detection rely on representing spatial interaction networks in Euclidean space, which results in significant distortion when modeling spatial interaction networks; since spatial community detection has no ground truth, this results in the detection and evaluation of communities being difficult. Furthermore, most methods usually ignore the dynamics of these spatial interaction networks, resulting in the dynamic evolution of spatial communities not being discussed in depth. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for community detection and evolutionary analysis for spatial interaction networks. Specifically, we construct a spatial interaction network based on network science theory, where geographic units serve as nodes and interaction relationships serve as edges. In order to fully learn the structural features of the spatial interaction network, we introduce a hyperbolic graph convolution module in the community detection phase to learn the spatial and non-spatial attributes of the spatial interaction network, obtain vector representations of the nodes, and optimize them based on a graph generation model to achieve the final community detection results. Considering the dynamics of spatial interactions, we analyze the evolution of the spatial community over time. Finally, using taxi trajectory data as an example, we conduct relevant experiments within the fifth ring road of Beijing.

We calculate a time series measure of migration rate and partition the time into optimal periods so that each period has a distinct migration network. We apply community detection to derive migration regions from each network of different periods. We map these regions and use a pair-counting measure to statistically compare the similarity of regions in consecutive time periods. Migration regions reveal the extent to which the strong regional identities we see today, and, in the past, which were rooted in migration. The North/South divide was pervasive not only in the early periods but throughout U.S. history.

Current research on scientists' mobility focuses on aggregated levels such as inter-country mobility, with little attention paid to fine-grained institutional level, leading to a simplified spatial portrayal of the mobility. To fill the gap, we take scientists in geography as examples, and reconstructed their dynamic mobility network among institutions from 1970 to 2020 based on massive literature metadata. Our findings reveal the spatial mobility pattern that is now dominated by North America, Western and Northern Europe, East Asia, and Oceania, with the trend of intensification, multipolarity, and inequality over time. Specifically, the mobility network exhibits clear community structure largely constrained by spatial proximity and national borders. We also uncovered a universal downward mobility pattern embedded in the hierarchical structure. Our quantitative analysis further suggest that mobility is facilitated by multiple realities, including spatial, cultural, and scientific proximity, institutional rankings and national economic levels, cooperation, and visa-free policies, with varying dynamics. These results contribute to spatiotemporal insights into the mechanisms of scientific development in theory, and the basis for talent policymaking in practice.","[Liu, Tianyu; Pei, Tao; Fang, Zidong; Wu, Mingbo; Liu, Xiaohan; Yan, Xiaorui; Song, Ci; Jiang, Jingyu; Chen, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tianyu; Pei, Tao; Fang, Zidong; Wu, Mingbo; Liu, Xiaohan; Yan, Xiaorui; Song, Ci] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pei, Tao] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jingyu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Linfeng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University; Lanzhou University","Pei, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Pei, T (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Pei, T (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Resou, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",peit@lreis.ac.cn,"Liu, Tianyu/JXM-6437-2024; 刘, 晓寒/JDC-9621-2023; wu, mingbo/N-4869-2018; Pei, Tao/KVB-5494-2024","Pei, Tao/0000-0002-5311-8761; Fang, Zidong/0000-0002-1902-4446; Wu, Mingbo/0000-0002-1236-7091; Yan, Xiaorui/0000-0002-4174-0561; Jiang, Linfeng/0000-0002-4844-9670; Liu, Tianyu/0000-0001-5045-8261",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071436]; Innovation Project of LREIS [KPI002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Project of LREIS,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 42071436] and the Innovation Project of LREIS [Grant No. KPI002].,,46,1,1,38,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1365-8816,1362-3087,,INT J GEOGR INF SCI,Int.

This new problem focuses on the dynamic process of the clustering rather than on the final picture of the clustering process. To address it, we introduce a new hierarchical clustering algorithm in networks, based on a new shortest path betweenness measure. To calculate it, the communication between each pair of nodes is weighed by the importance of the nodes that establish this communication. The weights or importance associated to each pair of nodes are calculated as the Shapley value of a game, named as the linear modularity game. This new measure, (the node-game shortest path betweenness measure), is used to obtain a hierarchical partition of the network by eliminating the link with the highest value. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we introduce several criteria that allow us to compare different dendrograms of a network from two point of view: modularity and homogeneity. Finally, we propose a faster algorithm based on a simplification of the node-game shortest path betweenness measure, whose order is quadratic on sparse networks. This fast version is competitive from a computational point of view with other hierarchical fast algorithms, and, in general, it provides better results.","[Gomez, Daniel; Castro, Javier; Gutierrez, Inmaculada; Espinola, Rosa] Complutense Univ Puerta de Hierro, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Gomez, Daniel; Castro, Javier; Espinola, Rosa] Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Evaluac Sanitaria, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Gutiérrez, I (corresponding author), Complutense Univ Puerta de Hierro, Fac Stat, Madrid 28040, Spain.",dagomez@estad.ucm.es; jcastroc@estad.ucm.es; inmaguti@ucm.es; rosaev@estad.ucm.es,"Espínola, Rosa/I-2908-2015; Gomez Gonzalez, Daniel/G-1586-2010; Castro, Javier/H-7220-2015","GUTIERREZ, INMACULADA/0000-0002-7103-393X; Gomez Gonzalez, Daniel/0000-0001-9548-5781; Castro, Javier/0000-0002-5345-8870","Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i [PID2020-116884GB-I00, PGC2018096509-B-I00]; Complutense University of Madrid [PR108/20-28, CT17/17-CT18/17]","Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i; Complutense University of Madrid","This research was funded by the Government of Spain, Grant Plan Nacional de I+D+i [PID2020-116884GB-I00 and PGC2018096509-B-I00] and the Complutense University of Madrid [PR108/20-28 and CT17/17-CT18/17.",,47,4,4,1,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,NOV,2021,9.0,21,,,,,,,2666,10.3390/math9212666,0.0,,,29,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,WY1XN,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000719077900001,0,Mathematics

However, batch information caused by batch effects is often confused with the intrinsic biological information in scRNA-seq data, which makes accurate clustering quite challenging. A Deep Adaptive Clustering with Adversarial Learning method (DACAL) is proposed here. DACAL jointly optimizes the batch correcting and clustering processes to remove batch effects while retaining biological information. DACAL achieves batch correction and adaptive clustering without requiring manually specified cell types or resolution parameters. DACAL is compared with other widely used batch correction and clustering methods on human pancreas datasets from different sequencing platforms and mouse mammary datasets from different laboratories. The results demonstrate that DACAL can correct batch effects efficiently and adaptively find accurate cell types, outperforming competing methods. Moreover, it can obtain cell subtypes with biological meanings.","[An, Sijing; Shi, Jinhui; Liu, Runyan; Wang, Jing; Hu, Shuofeng; Dong, Guohua; Ying, Xiaomin; He, Zhen] Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China",Academy of Military Medical Sciences - China,"Ying, XM; He, Z (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China.",ansijing66@gmail.com; shijinhui93@163.com; runyanliu11@gmail.com; jingwangv@foxmail.com; hushuofeng08@163.com; dgh1991.learn@gmail.com; yingxm@bmi.ac.cn; hezhen1@bmi.ac.cn,"Shi, Jinhui/KHZ-9803-2024; Wang, Jing/JYO-7698-2024; An, Sijing/KEE-6797-2024; Hu, Shuofeng/AAT-5380-2021","Ying, Xiaomin/0000-0001-6126-7372; Shi, Jinhui/0009-0001-0292-1298",National Key R&D Program of China,National Key R&D Program of China,No Statement Available,,25,0,0,5,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,DEC,2023,11.0,24,,,,,,,4901,10.3390/math11244901,0.0,,,12,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,DF8D9,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001130697300001,0,Mathematics

We illustrate SLI node importance differentiation among nodes in lexical networks and demonstrate its potential in natural language processing (NLP). In the NLP task of sense identification and sense structure analysis, the SLI centrality measure evaluates node integration and provides the necessary local resolution by differentiating the importance of nodes to a greater extent than standard centrality measures. This provides the relevant topological information about different subnetworks based on relatively local information, revealing the more complex sense structure.

Cell types consist of hierarchical structures that perform functions differently. Constructing a hierarchical structure of cell types is crucial for revealing relationships between cell types. Existing hierarchical methods construct cell type hierarchy with fixed branches which cannot reflect actual cell type hierarchy, and cannot adapt to large-scale unlabeled data. To fill the gap, we propose scHSD, a hierarchical structure detecting method which allows construct cell type hierarchy that closely actual structures, and is capable of handling large-scale data. scHSD first constructs a cell-cell similarity graph and conducts coarse-graining to minimize graph size. Then, scHSD leverages structural entropy minimization on the coarse-grained graph to build cell type hierarchy. scHSD adjusts hierarchy height and the number of branches during structural entropy minimization. To validate the method's effectiveness, we conduct experiments on datasets of different scales and compared the hierarchical structure with known cell type hierarchy. The experimental results demonstrate that our method accurately construct cell type hierarchy and can be used for cell clustering and classification.

Inter-individual variation in modular structure has been linked to differences in performance, disease, and development. There exist many data-driven methods for detecting and comparing modular structure, the most popular of which is modularity maximization. Although modularity maximization is a general framework that can be modified and reparamaterized to address domain-specific research questions, its application to neuroscientific datasets has, thus far, been narrow. Here, we highlight several strategies in which the out-of-the-box version of modularity maximization can be extended to address questions specific to neuroscience. First, we present approaches for detecting space-independent modules and for applying modularity maximization to signed matrices. Next, we show that the modularity maximization frame is well-suited for detecting task- and condition-specific modules. Finally, we highlight the role of mull-layer models in detecting and tracking modules across time, tasks, subjects, and modalities. In summary, modularity maximization is a flexible and general framework that can be adapted to detect modular structure resulting from a wide range of hypotheses. This article highlights multiple frontiers for future research and applications.","[Esfahlani, Farnaz Zamani; Jo, Youngheun; Puxeddu, Maria Grazia; Greenwell, Sarah; Patel, Riya; Faskowitz, Joshua; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Faskowitz, Joshua] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Sapienza University Rome; IRCCS Santa Lucia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rbetzel@indiana.edu,"Betzel, Richard/AFL-9399-2022; Faskowitz, Josh/K-1330-2019; Jo, Youngheun/JUV-2426-2023; Puxeddu, Maria/L-1614-2019",,,,,,131,20,20,2,34,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,DEC 1,2021,244.0,,,,,,,,118607,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118607,0.0,,OCT 2021,15,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",WK8LO,34607022.0,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000709972900016,0,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging"

Large studies of brain community structure often include images acquired on multiple scanners across different studies. Differences in scanner can introduce variability into the downstream results, and these differences are often referred to as scanner effects. Such effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common network metrics. In this study, we identify scanner effects in data-driven community detection results and related network metrics. We assess a commonly employed harmonization method and propose new methodology for harmonizing functional connectivity that leverage existing knowledge about network structure as well as patterns of covariance in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that our new methods reduce scanner effects in community structure and network metrics. Our results highlight scanner effects in studies of brain functional organization and provide additional tools to address these unwanted effects. These findings and methods can be incorporated into future functional connectivity studies, potentially preventing spurious findings and improving reliability of results.","[Chen, Andrew A.; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen, Andrew A.; Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Ctr Biomed Image Comp & Analyt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos] Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pomponio, Raymond] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Resnick, Susan M.; Beason-Held, Lori L.] NIA, Lab Behav Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Penn Lifespan Informat & Neuroimaging Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Nuerol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Colorado School of Public Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; The Santa Fe Institute,"Chen, AA (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",andrewac@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,"Nasrallah, Ilya/KHW-9095-2024; Fan, Yong/O-4412-2014; Satterthwaite, Theodore/N-4804-2017","Chen, Andrew/0000-0002-5027-6422; Pomponio, Raymond/0000-0003-0434-4751; Bassett, Danielle/0000-0002-6183-4493; Satterthwaite, Theodore/0000-0001-7072-9399; Nasrallah, Ilya/0000-0003-2346-7562","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01 NS085211, R01 NS060910]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG-170728586]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, R01EB022573]; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409]; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01EB022573]; University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (Grant numbers R01 NS085211 and R01 NS060910), the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG-170728586), the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, and R01EB022573), the National Institute on Aging (RF1AG054409), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (R01EB022573), and a seed grant from the University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA).

Currently, there is no clear standard or systematic approach for selecting the most appropriate community detection method. Furthermore, the impact of method choice on the accuracy and robustness of estimated communities (and network modularity), as well as method-dependent relationships between network communities and cognitive and other individual measures, are not well understood. This study analyzed large datasets of real brain networks (estimated from resting-state fMRI from n$$ n $$ = 5251 pre/early adolescents in the adolescent brain cognitive development [ABCD] study), and n$$ n $$ = 5338 synthetic networks with heterogeneous, data-inspired topologies, with the goal to investigate and compare three classes of community detection methods: (i) modularity maximization-based (Newman and Louvain), (ii) probabilistic (Bayesian inference within the framework of stochastic block modeling (SBM)), and (iii) geometric (based on graph Ricci flow). Extensive comparisons between methods and their individual accuracy (relative to the ground truth in synthetic networks), and reliability (when applied to multiple fMRI runs from the same brains) suggest that the underlying brain network topology plays a critical role in the accuracy, reliability and agreement of community detection methods. Consistent method (dis)similarities, and their correlations with topological properties, were estimated across fMRI runs. Based on synthetic graphs, most methods performed similarly and had comparable high accuracy only in some topological regimes, specifically those corresponding to developed connectomes with at least quasi-optimal community organization. In contrast, in densely and/or weakly connected networks with difficult to detect communities, the methods yielded highly dissimilar results, with Bayesian inference within SBM having significantly higher accuracy compared to all others. Associations between method-specific modularity and demographic, anthropometric, physiological and cognitive parameters showed mostly method invariance but some method dependence as well. Although method sensitivity to different levels of community structure may in part explain method-dependent associations between modularity estimates and parameters of interest, method dependence also highlights potential issues of reliability and reproducibility. These findings suggest that a probabilistic approach, such as Bayesian inference in the framework of SBM, may provide consistently reliable estimates of community structure across network topologies. In addition, to maximize robustness of biological inferences, identified network communities and their cognitive, behavioral and other correlates should be confirmed with multiple reliable detection methods. Network communities are a fundamental characteristic of human brain's circuit organization. Community detection methods are differentially sensitive to the connectome topology and can yield highly dissimilar estimates, especially in underdeveloped brains, leading to method-dependent mappings to cognitive and other parameters. A probabilistic approach may be more robust than modularity-maximization and geometric methods. image","[Brooks, Skylar J.; Golding, Staunton G.

Further integration with cell-type deconvolution analysis extends its application to datasets with any spatial resolution.

The model is compared to an ANN model using functional group counts and modularity as inputs. A dataset covering 430 molecules and temperature range between 253 and 463 K was employed to develop the models. The application of community detection resulted into 177 modules, which captured a wide range of molecular fragments and features, including polyfunctional molecules. The model was then reduced to 158 modules to improve performance considering statistical significance, correlation among inputs, relative importance in the ANN model and identification of outliers. The final modules model demonstrated improved performance on the training and test sets compared to the functional groups ANN model and showed excellent predictions for all compound classes. The model was then used to predict the viscosity of molecules potentially derived from biomass used in existing models, which served for further model validation. The final modules model showed improved performance based on the root mean squared error in comparison to existing models. This demonstrates the advantage of employing modularity and the modules identified by the community detection algorithm as molecular descriptors. The approach extends the potential of the application of community detection to molecular graphs and modularity to capture structure-property relationships for predicting molecular properties.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Zenteno, Citlalli; Valencia, Diego; Aburto, Jorge] Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021",,"Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) [540821111]; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT [781507]; [Y.62001]","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS); UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT));","This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

Among others, this includes principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which aim to maximize the variance and the time scale of the first components, respectively. A crucial first step of such an analysis is the identification of suitable and relevant input coordinates (the so-called features), such as backbone dihedral angles and interresidue distances. As typically only a small subset of those coordinates is involved in a specific biomolecular process, it is important to discard the remaining uncorrelated motions or weakly correlated noise coordinates. This is because they may exhibit large amplitudes or long time scales and therefore will be erroneously considered important by PCA and TICA, respectively. To discriminate collective motions underlying functional dynamics from uncorrelated motions, the correlation matrix of the input coordinates is block-diagonalized by a clustering method. This strategy avoids possible bias due to presumed functional observables and conformational states or variation principles that maximize variance or time scales. Considering several linear and nonlinear correlation measures and various clustering algorithms, it is shown that the combination of linear correlation and the Leiden community detection algorithm yields excellent results for all considered model systems. These include the functional motion of T4 lysozyme to demonstrate the successful identification of collective motion, as well as the folding of the villin headpiece to highlight the physical interpretation of the correlated motions in terms of a functional mechanism.","[Diez, Georg; Nagel, Daniel; Stock, Gerhard] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Stock, G (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",stock@physik.uni-freiburg.de,,"Nagel, Daniel/0000-0002-2863-2646; Diez, Georg/0000-0002-4114-1577","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR 5099, 431945604, 37/935-1 FUGG]; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen,"The authors thank Matthias Post, Steffen Wolf, Sofia Sartore, and Marius Lange for fruitful discussions and D.

On the other hand, if the network reveals a leadership structure, it is possible to understand the mechanisms of information dissemination on it. The detection of leaders and communities is a big challenge depending on the complexity level of the network. In the literature, there are some metaheuristic algorithms for detecting leaders and communities based on pattern recognition on the graph associated with the network. In this paper, we developed a random graph system to generate a synthetic network instance with leader and community structures that define a ground truth. We compare this ground truth to determine the performance of the algorithms LCDA 1 and LCDA 2 for detecting leaders and communities.

Pandemic response policies guided by geospatial approaches are appropriate additions to traditional epidemiological responses when addressing this disaster. However, little is known about finding the optimal set of locations or jurisdictions to create policy coordination zones. In this study, we propose optimization models and algorithms to identify coordination communities based on the natural movement of people. To do so, we develop a mixed-integer quadratic-programming model to maximize the modularity of detected communities while ensuring that the jurisdictions within each community are contiguous. To solve the problem, we present a heuristic and a column-generation algorithm. Our computational experiments highlight the effectiveness of the models and algorithms in various instances. We also apply the proposed optimization-based solutions to identify coordination zones within North Carolina and South Carolina, two highly interconnected states in the U.S. Results of our case study show that the proposed model detects communities that are significantly better for coordinating pandemic related policies than the existing geopolitical boundaries.

Based on a largescale dataset, this paper analyses the characteristics and networks of this wider population of directors. The study goes beyond previous work, which has mainly focused on elite directors or prominent companies, and shows three key findings. First, the population of directors was very connected into a large network, complete isolation from this network was rare. Second, over 1881-1911 director interlocks with banks became less important for most sectors, while interlocks with other financial institutions such as trusts became increasingly important.

In order to provide students enrolled in our course projects with an optimal team recommendation, we have devised a highly efficient strategy. This strategy involves utilizing their personalities and assessing their collaborative effectiveness through individual personality questionnaires. Additionally, we employ community detection using the Leiden algorithm. In order to assess the soundness of our recommendation technique, we conducted an evaluation of current algorithms that have been employed for this purpose, taking into account their modularity scores and the decision to establish preferred team sizes. The assessment section presents results that demonstrate how the Leiden algorithm outperforms competing algorithms and techniques that rely on clustering coefficients. Specifically, the Leiden algorithm is capable of recommending study partners that possess many personality features that match the user and their respective teams.","[Obionwu, Chukwuka Victor; Ilapavuluri, Devi Prasad; Saake, Gunter] Univ Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany; [Broneske, David] German Ctr Higher Educ Res & Sci Studies, Hannover, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Obionwu, CV (corresponding author), Univ Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.",obionwu@vgu.de,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-031-67903-2; 978-3-031-67904-9,COMM COM INF SC,,,2024,2132.0,,,,,,76,98,,10.1007/978-3-031-67904-9_5,0.0,,,23,Business,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BX7GL,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001321473300005,0,Business

Study Design and Setting: Using cross-sectional self-reported data on 24 diseases from 30,097 community-living adults aged 45 e 85 from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we conducted network analyses using 5 clustering methods and 11 association measures commonly used in multimorbidity studies. We compared the similarity among clusters using the adjusted Rand index (ARI); an ARI of 0 is equivalent to the diseases being randomly assigned to clusters, and 1 indicates perfect agreement. We compared the network analysis results to disease clusters independently identified by two clinicians. Results: Results differed greatly across combinations of association measures and cluster algorithms. The number of clusters identified ranged from 1 to 24, with a low similarity of conditions within clusters. Compared to clinician-derived clusters, ARIs ranged from- 0.02 to 0.24, indicating little similarity. Conclusion: These analyses demonstrate the need for a systematic evaluation of the performance of network analysis methods on binary clustered data like diseases. Moreover, in individual older adults, diseases may not cluster predictably, highlighting the need for a personalized approach to their care. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

There is a lack of comprehensive and factual data-based analyses of e-scooter crashes and their causes. We collected 1936 crash-related reports over two years via the German press portal based on a systematic web content mining process. Sentiment analysis results revealed that the police reports' coverage is predominantly factual and neutral and, therefore, useful for keyword-based analyses. After identifying the 46 most relevant keywords in the reports, we generated an adjacency matrix to investigate the keywords' dependencies, visualized the network and dependencies of the most relevant keywords, and categorized them into four thematic clusters using the Louvain algorithm. Our results and findings reveal that driving under drug influence, especially alcohol, is one serious problem. Riding e-scooter in pairs and on forbidden terrain or in the wrong direction are also common causes of crashes. Consequences for e-scooter riders are severe injuries, driving license revocation, fines, criminal charges, and incurring for property damage. Further, wearing protective gear and helmets is of low acceptance among the e-scooter ridership. Based on our results and findings, we recommend e-scooter bans during the night times for some locations, obligatory driving tests before first e-scooter use, and helmet wearing.","[Brauner, Tim; Heumann, Maximilian; Kraschewski, Tobias; Prahlow, Oliver; Rehse, Jan; Kiehne, Christian; Breitner, Michael H.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Brauner, T (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",brauner@iwi.uni-hannover.de,"; Heumann, Maximilian/JVN-5695-2024","Breitner, Michael/0000-0001-7315-3022; Brauner, Tim/0000-0003-3260-5015; Heumann, Maximilian/0000-0002-3765-7423",,,,,57,11,11,1,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0001-4575,1879-2057,,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,Accid.

In this study, we use the scientific collaboration network technique to explore the evolving history and scientific collaboration patterns of contact tracing. It is observed that the number of articles on the subject remained at a low level before 2020, probably because the practical significance of the contact tracing model was not widely accepted by the academic community. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented research boom to contact tracing, as evidenced by the explosion of the literature after 2020. Tuberculosis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases were common types of diseases studied in contact tracing before 2020. In contrast, research on contact tracing regarding COVID-19 occupies a significantly large proportion after 2000. It is also found from the collaboration networks that academic teams in the field tend to conduct independent research, rather than cross-team collaboration, which is not conducive to knowledge dissemination and information flow.","[Li, Hui; Zhu, Yifei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Niu, Yi] China Publishing Grp Digital Media Co Ltd, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Li, H (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",ray@mail.buct.edu.cn; 2020210440@mail.buct.edu.cn; niuyi@cnpubg.com,"Li, Hui/AAB-7146-2019","Li, Hui/0000-0002-8866-5941",Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences [21YJAZH040]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1636208],Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the Ministry of Education in China (MOE) under project grants of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 21YJAZH040), and this research was also funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under project grants of the general technical foundation research joint fund (No. U1636208).",,61,4,5,1,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Most studies to date have only focused on the effect of specific disorders on infection severity, without considering that patients usually present multiple chronic diseases and that these conditions tend to group together in the form of multimorbidity patterns. In this large-scale epidemiological study, including primary and hospital care information of 166,242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from the Spanish region of Andalusia, we applied network analysis to identify multimorbidity profiles and analyze their impact on the risk of hospitalization and mortality. Our results showed that multimorbidity was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and that this risk increased with the morbidity burden. Individuals with advanced cardio-metabolic profiles frequently presented the highest infection severity risk in both sexes. The pattern with the highest severity associated in men was present in almost 28.7% of those aged >= 80 years and included associations between cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases; age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (1.71 (1.44-2.02)). In women, similar patterns were also associated the most with infection severity, in 7% of 65-79-year-olds (1.44 (1.34-1.54)) and in 29% of >= 80-year-olds (1.35 (1.18-1.53)). Patients with mental health patterns also showed one of the highest risks of COVID-19 severity, especially in women. These findings strongly recommend the implementation of personalized approaches to patients with multimorbidity and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the population with high morbidity burden.","[Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas] Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Carmona-Pirez, Jonas; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca; Prados-Torres, Alexandra] ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, WHO Collaborating Ctr Drug Stat Methodol, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Drug Stat, Div Hlth Data & Digitalisat, NO-0213 Oslo, Norway; [Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios; Gonzalez-Rubio, Francisca] Spanish Soc Family & Community Med SEMFYC, Drug Utilizat Work Grp, Barcelona 08009, Spain; [Munoyerro-Muniz, Dolores; Rodriguez-Herrera, Juliana; Antonio Goicoechea-Salazar, Juan; Villegas-Portero, Roman] Serv Andaluz Salud SAS, Subdirecc Tecn Asesora Gest Informac, Seville 41071, Spain",Miguel Servet University Hospital; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), Miguel Servet Univ Hosp, Aragon Hlth Sci Inst IACS, IIS Aragon, EpiChron Res Grp, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network REDISSEC, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), Aragon Hlth Serv SALUD, Delicias Sur Primary Care Hlth Ctr, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.;Carmona-Pírez, J (corresponding author), ISCIII, Red Invest Cronicidad Atenc Primaria & Promoc Sal, Madrid 28029, Spain.",jcarmona@iisaragon.es; ignatios.ioakeimskoufa@fhi.no; agimenomi.iacs@aragon.es; bpoblador.iacs@aragon.es; franciscagonzalezrubio@gmail.com; dolores.munoyerro.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; juliana.rodriguez.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; jantonio.goicoechea@juntadeandalucia.es; sprados.iacs@aragon.es; romanp.villegas@juntadeandalucia.es,"Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/AAX-4807-2020; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/GPT-3556-2022; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz/ABC-7915-2020; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio/AAC-9611-2019; Carmona Pirez, Jonas/AAE-8594-2022; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/P-5818-2017; Villegas, Roman/J-9159-2016","Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios/0000-0002-6518-749X; Gonzalez Rubio, Francisca/0000-0001-5939-4436; Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio/0000-0002-5440-1710; Carmona-Pirez, Jonas/0000-0002-6268-8803; Prados-Torres, Alexandra/0000-0002-5704-6056; Poblador-Plou, Beatriz/0000-0002-5119-5093; Villegas, Roman/0000-0003-0845-0172","Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [CM19/00164, RD21/0016/0019]; Gobierno de Aragon [B01_20R, DECRETO-LEY 3/2020]; European Union-NextGenerationEU",Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon; Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Gobierno de Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Union-NextGenerationEU,"This work was cofunded by Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon and Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Rio Hortega Program, grant number CM19/00164; RICAPPS, grant number RD21/0016/0019), Gobierno de Aragon (Grant numbers B01_20R and DECRETO-LEY 3/2020, de 3 de junio, del Gobierno de Aragon) and the European Union-NextGenerationEU.",,58,4,4,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

However, the existing clustering techniques often struggle to provide timely and accurate cell type groupings when dealing with datasets with large-scale or imbalanced cell types. Therefore, there is a need for improved methods that can handle the increasing size of scRNA-seq datasets while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency. Methods We propose CDSKNNXMBD (Community Detection based on a Stable K-Nearest Neighbor Graph Structure), a novel single-cell clustering framework integrating partition clustering algorithm and community detection algorithm, which achieves accurate and fast cell type grouping by finding a stable graph structure. Results We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing 15 tissues from the human fetal atlas. Compared to existing methods, CDSKNN effectively counteracts the high imbalance in single-cell data, enabling effective clustering. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons across multiple single-cell datasets from different studies and sequencing techniques. CDSKNN is of high applicability and robustness, and capable of balancing the complexities of across diverse types of data. Most importantly, CDSKNN exhibits higher operational efficiency on datasets at the million-cell scale, requiring an average of only 6.33 min for clustering 1.46 million single cells, saving 33.3% to 99% of running time compared to those of existing methods. Conclusions The CDSKNN is a flexible, resilient, and promising clustering tool that is particularly suitable for clustering imbalanced data and demonstrates high efficiency on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.","[Ren, Jun; Shi, Xiaodong] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361105, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hematol, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Inst Hematol, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun; Lyu, Xuejing; Guo, Jintao; Zhou, Ying; Li, Qiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Natl Inst Data Sci Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hematol, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Inst Hematol, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y; Li, QY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Natl Inst Data Sci Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.",yingzhou@xmu.edu.cn; qiyuan.li@xmu.edu.cn,"zhou, ying/LUY-9551-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),None.,,43,0,0,6,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1479-5876,,J TRANSL MED,J.

Erythropoiesis is hierarchical in that it results from a series of cell fate decisions whereby hematopoietic stem cells progress toward the erythroid lineage. Single -cell transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have revolutionized the way we understand erythropoiesis, revealing it to be a gradual process that underlies a progressive restriction of fate potential driven by quantitative changes in lineage -specifying transcription factors. Despite these major advances, we still know very little about what cell fate decision entails at the molecular level. Novel approaches that simultaneously measure additional properties in single cells, including chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and/or cell surface proteins are being developed at a fast pace, providing the means to exciting new advances in the near future. In this review, we briefly summarize the main findings obtained from single -cell studies of erythropoiesis, highlight outstanding questions, and suggest recent technological advances to address them.

This study aims to identify drug repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM by developing an integrative rare disease profile network containing heterogeneous types of biomedical data.MethodsWe developed a Glioblastoma-based Biomedical Profile Network (GBPN) by extracting and integrating biomedical information pertinent to GBM-related diseases from the NCATS GARD Knowledge Graph (NGKG). We further clustered the GBPN based on modularity classes which resulted in multiple focused subgraphs, named mc_GBPN. We then identified high-influence nodes by performing network analysis over the mc_GBPN and validated those nodes that could be potential drug repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM.ResultsWe developed the GBPN with 1,466 nodes and 107,423 edges and consequently the mc_GBPN with forty-one modularity classes. A list of the ten most influential nodes were identified from the mc_GBPN. These notably include Riluzole, stem cell therapy, cannabidiol, and VK-0214, with proven evidence for treating GBM.ConclusionOur GBM-targeted network analysis allowed us to effectively identify potential candidates for drug repurposing or repositioning.

To leverage the full potential of roadside 4D MMW radars, an innovative traffic detection method is proposed based on their distinctive data characteristics. First, velocity-based filtering and region of interest (ROI) extraction were employed to filter and associate point data by merging the point cloud frames to enhance the point relationship. Then, the Louvain algorithm was used to divide the graph into modularity by converting the point cloud data into graph structure and amplifying the differences with the Gaussian kernel function. Finally, a detection augmentation method is introduced to address the problems of over-clustering and under-clustering based on the object ID characteristics of 4D MMW radar data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method obtained the highest average precision and F1 score: 98.15% and 98.58%, respectively.

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.","[Liu, Qiliang; Hou, Zhaoyi; Yang, Jie] Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jie_yang@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41971353, 41730105]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ20058, 2020JJ4695]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province [KT202110, KT202002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded through support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 41971353 and 41730105), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2021JJ20058 and 2020JJ4695), and the water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province (No. KT202110 and KT202002).",,43,1,1,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4144,10.3390/rs14174144,0.0,,,20,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4K1ZE,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000851756200001,0,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology

In this paper, we introduce RCDVis, a visual analysis system designed to support prior-free rare category detection on graph data. RCDVis adopts a community detection-based algorithm RCDGD to identify candidate vertices of rare categories. Furthermore, the algorithm is tightly integrated with an interactive interface which supports the effective exploration of graph data and the labeling of rare categories.

Thyroxine (T4) administration has been shown to prevent the cognitive impairments induced by mTBI in mice but the mechanism is poorly understood. To understand the underlying mechanism, we carried out a single cell transcriptomic study to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of T4 on individual cell types in the hippocampus and frontal cortex at three post-injury stages in a mouse model of mTBI. We found that T4 treatment altered the proportions and transcriptomes of numerous cell types across tissues and timepoints, particularly oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, which are crucial for injury repair. T4 also reversed the expression of mTBI-affected genes such as Ttr, mt-Rnr2, , Ggn12, Malat1, Gnaq, and Myo3a, , as well as numerous pathways such as cell/energy/iron metabolism, immune response, nervous system, and cytoskeleton-related pathways. Cell-type specific network modeling revealed that T4 mitigated select mTBIperturbed dynamic shifts in subnetworks related to cell cycle, stress response, and RNA processing in oligodendrocytes. Cross cell-type ligand-receptor networks revealed the roles of App, Hmgb1, Fn1, and Tnf in mTBI, with the latter two ligands having been previously identified as TBI network hubs. mTBI and/or T4 signature genes were enriched for human genome-wide association study (GWAS) candidate genes for cognitive, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders related to mTBI. Our systems-level single cell analysis elucidated the temporal and spatial dynamic reprogramming of cell-type specific genes, pathways, and networks, as well as cell- cell communications as the mechanisms through which T4 mitigates cognitive dysfunction induced by mTBI.","[Zhang, Guanglin; Diamante, Graciel; Ahn, In Sook; Palafox-Sanchez, Victoria; Cheng, Jenny; Cheng, Michael; Ying, Zhe; Wang, Susanna Sue-Ming; Phi, Nguyen; Arneson, Douglas; Cely, Ingrid; Arellano, Kayla; Wang, Ning; Gomez-Pinilla, Fernando; Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Cheng, Jenny; Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Mol Cellular & Integrat Physiol Interdept Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Cheng, Michael; Arneson, Douglas; Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Bioinformat Interdept Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Abuhanna, Kevin Daniel] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Zhang, Shujing; Peng, Chao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Peng, Chao; Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Mol Biol Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Peng, Chao; Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Peng, Chao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Mary S Easton Ctr Alzheimers Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Gomez-Pinilla, Fernando] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gomez-Pinilla, Fernando] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Injury Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Quantitat & Computat Biosci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yang, Xia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Yang, X (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",xyang123@ucla.edu,"Zhang, Shujing/KAL-9817-2024; Cheng, Fangyi/E-3917-2015; Zhang, Guanglin/IUP-1855-2023","Abuhanna, Kevin/0000-0003-0994-7658",,,X.Y. and F.G-P. are funded by R01 NS117148.

Having both expression profiles and tissue organization enables researchers to better understand cellular interactions and heterogeneity, providing insight into complex biological processes that would not be possible with traditional sequencing technologies. Data generated by ST technologies are inherently noisy, high-dimensional, sparse, and multi-modal (including histological images, count matrices, etc.), thus requiring specialized computational tools for accurate and robust analysis. However, many ST studies currently utilize traditional scRNAseq tools, which are inadequate for analyzing complex ST datasets. On the other hand, many of the existing ST-specific methods are built upon traditional statistical or machine learning frameworks, which have shown to be sub-optimal in many applications due to the scale, multi-modality, and limitations of spatially resolved data (such as spatial resolution, sensitivity, and gene coverage). Given these intricacies, researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based models to alleviate ST-specific challenges. These methods include new state-of-the-art models in alignment, spatial reconstruction, and spatial clustering, among others. However, DL models for ST analysis are nascent and remain largely underexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of existing state-of-the-art tools for analyzing spatially resolved transcriptomics while delving deeper into the DL-based approaches. We discuss the new frontiers and the open questions in this field and highlight domains in which we anticipate transformational DL applications.","[Heydari, A.

The paper at hand introduces a novel unsupervised technique to semantically identify the position of an autonomous agent in unknown environments. When the robot explores a certain path for the first time, community detection is achieved through graph-based segmentation. This allows the agent to semantically define its surroundings in future traverses even if the environment's lighting conditions are changed. The proposed semantic clustering technique exploits the Louvain community detection algorithm, which constitutes a novel and efficient method for identifying groups of measurements with consistent similarity. The produced communities are combined with metric information, as provided by the robot's odometry through a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method.

In this paper, we present a graph-based unsupervised semantic clustering method and a novel cluster matching technique, with a view to create a multi-layer semantic memory map robust to illumination changes. Using indoor data collected by an unmanned aerial robot (UAR) and a publicly available dataset, we apply a community detection algorithm (CDA) to find efficiently coherent visual data throughout the trajectory creating a semantic base map. Then, we optimize the formed communities using metric information by implementing an hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. The multilayer semantic map is created by constructing map instances for variant lighting conditions and matching the generated clusters to their base map correspondence. The proposed matching method relies on the graphs centrality indicators to identify central images of a region and utilize them to efficiently extract resemblances within the base map.","[Papapetros, Ioannis Tsampikos; Balaska, Vasiliki; Gasteratos, Antonios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Papapetros, IT (corresponding author), Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece.",,"Gasteratos, Antonios/AAI-4740-2021",,,,,,35,17,17,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2373-6720,,978-1-7281-4278-4,INT CONF UNMAN AIRCR,,,2020,,,,,,,1206.0,1212.0,,10.1109/icuas48674.2020.9213923,0.0,,,7,Robotics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,BQ6IY,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000612041300155,0,Robotics

Currently, there is no clear standard or systematic approach for selecting the most appropriate community detection method. Furthermore, the impact of method choice on the accuracy and robustness of estimated communities (and network modularity), as well as method-dependent relationships between network communities and cognitive and other individual measures, are not well understood. This study analyzed large datasets of real brain networks (estimated from resting-state fMRI from n$$ n $$ = 5251 pre/early adolescents in the adolescent brain cognitive development [ABCD] study), and n$$ n $$ = 5338 synthetic networks with heterogeneous, data-inspired topologies, with the goal to investigate and compare three classes of community detection methods: (i) modularity maximization-based (Newman and Louvain), (ii) probabilistic (Bayesian inference within the framework of stochastic block modeling (SBM)), and (iii) geometric (based on graph Ricci flow). Extensive comparisons between methods and their individual accuracy (relative to the ground truth in synthetic networks), and reliability (when applied to multiple fMRI runs from the same brains) suggest that the underlying brain network topology plays a critical role in the accuracy, reliability and agreement of community detection methods. Consistent method (dis)similarities, and their correlations with topological properties, were estimated across fMRI runs. Based on synthetic graphs, most methods performed similarly and had comparable high accuracy only in some topological regimes, specifically those corresponding to developed connectomes with at least quasi-optimal community organization. In contrast, in densely and/or weakly connected networks with difficult to detect communities, the methods yielded highly dissimilar results, with Bayesian inference within SBM having significantly higher accuracy compared to all others. Associations between method-specific modularity and demographic, anthropometric, physiological and cognitive parameters showed mostly method invariance but some method dependence as well. Although method sensitivity to different levels of community structure may in part explain method-dependent associations between modularity estimates and parameters of interest, method dependence also highlights potential issues of reliability and reproducibility. These findings suggest that a probabilistic approach, such as Bayesian inference in the framework of SBM, may provide consistently reliable estimates of community structure across network topologies. In addition, to maximize robustness of biological inferences, identified network communities and their cognitive, behavioral and other correlates should be confirmed with multiple reliable detection methods. Network communities are a fundamental characteristic of human brain's circuit organization. Community detection methods are differentially sensitive to the connectome topology and can yield highly dissimilar estimates, especially in underdeveloped brains, leading to method-dependent mappings to cognitive and other parameters. A probabilistic approach may be more robust than modularity-maximization and geometric methods. image","[Brooks, Skylar J.; Golding, Staunton G.

Such effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common network metrics. In this study, we identify scanner effects in data-driven community detection results and related network metrics. We assess a commonly employed harmonization method and propose new methodology for harmonizing functional connectivity that leverage existing knowledge about network structure as well as patterns of covariance in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that our new methods reduce scanner effects in community structure and network metrics. Our results highlight scanner effects in studies of brain functional organization and provide additional tools to address these unwanted effects. These findings and methods can be incorporated into future functional connectivity studies, potentially preventing spurious findings and improving reliability of results.","[Chen, Andrew A.; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen, Andrew A.; Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos; Satterthwaite, Theodore D.; Shinohara, Russell T.; Shou, Haochang] Univ Penn, Ctr Biomed Image Comp & Analyt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Srinivasan, Dhivya; Fan, Yong; Nasrallah, Ilya M.; Davatzikos, Christos] Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pomponio, Raymond] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Resnick, Susan M.; Beason-Held, Lori L.] NIA, Lab Behav Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Penn Lifespan Informat & Neuroimaging Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Satterthwaite, Theodore D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Nuerol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Dani S.] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Colorado School of Public Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; The Santa Fe Institute,"Chen, AA (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Penn Stat Imaging & Visualizat Ctr, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",andrewac@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,"Nasrallah, Ilya/KHW-9095-2024; Fan, Yong/O-4412-2014; Satterthwaite, Theodore/N-4804-2017","Chen, Andrew/0000-0002-5027-6422; Pomponio, Raymond/0000-0003-0434-4751; Bassett, Danielle/0000-0002-6183-4493; Satterthwaite, Theodore/0000-0001-7072-9399; Nasrallah, Ilya/0000-0003-2346-7562","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01 NS085211, R01 NS060910]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG-170728586]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, R01EB022573]; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409]; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01EB022573]; University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH; National Institute on Aging [RF1AG054409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (Grant numbers R01 NS085211 and R01 NS060910), the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG-170728586), the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH112847, R01MH120482, R01 MH123550, R37MH125829, and R01EB022573), the National Institute on Aging (RF1AG054409), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (R01EB022573), and a seed grant from the University of Pennsylvania Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA).

Inter-individual variation in modular structure has been linked to differences in performance, disease, and development. There exist many data-driven methods for detecting and comparing modular structure, the most popular of which is modularity maximization. Although modularity maximization is a general framework that can be modified and reparamaterized to address domain-specific research questions, its application to neuroscientific datasets has, thus far, been narrow. Here, we highlight several strategies in which the out-of-the-box version of modularity maximization can be extended to address questions specific to neuroscience. First, we present approaches for detecting space-independent modules and for applying modularity maximization to signed matrices. Next, we show that the modularity maximization frame is well-suited for detecting task- and condition-specific modules. Finally, we highlight the role of mull-layer models in detecting and tracking modules across time, tasks, subjects, and modalities. In summary, modularity maximization is a flexible and general framework that can be adapted to detect modular structure resulting from a wide range of hypotheses. This article highlights multiple frontiers for future research and applications.","[Esfahlani, Farnaz Zamani; Jo, Youngheun; Puxeddu, Maria Grazia; Greenwell, Sarah; Patel, Riya; Faskowitz, Joshua; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Puxeddu, Maria Grazia] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob C.; Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Faskowitz, Joshua] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Betzel, Richard F.] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Sapienza University Rome; IRCCS Santa Lucia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Betzel, RF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rbetzel@indiana.edu,"Betzel, Richard/AFL-9399-2022; Faskowitz, Josh/K-1330-2019; Jo, Youngheun/JUV-2426-2023; Puxeddu, Maria/L-1614-2019",,,,,,131,20,20,2,34,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,DEC 1,2021,244.0,,,,,,,,118607,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118607,0.0,,OCT 2021,15,Neuroimaging,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",WK8LO,34607022.0,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000709972900016,0,Neuroimaging

While the differential expression of Hox genes shifts from the anterior-posterior (A-P) to the proximal-distal (P-D) axis around embryonic day 11 (E11), whether this shift coincides with a more global change of A-P to P-D patterning program remains unclear. By performing and analyzing the transcriptome of the developing limb bud from E10.5 to E12.5, at single-cell resolution, we have uncovered transcriptional trajectories that revealed a general switch from A-P to P-D genetic program between E10.5 and E11.5. Interestingly, all the transcriptional trajectories at E10.5 end with cells expressing either proximal or distal markers suggesting a progressive acquisition of P-D identity. Moreover, we identified three categories of genes expressed in the distal limb mesenchyme characterized by distinct temporal expression dynamics. Among these are Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 (Hox13 hereafter), which start to be expressed around E10.5, and importantly the binding of the HOX13 factors was observed within or in the neighborhood of several of the distal limb genes. Our data are consistent with previous evidence suggesting that the transition from the early/proximal to the late/distal transcriptome of the limb mesenchyme largely relies on HOX13 function. Based on these results and the evidence that HOX13 factors restrict Hoxa11 expression to the proximal limb, in progenitor cells of the zeugopod, we propose that HOX13 act as a key determinant of P-D patterning.","[Desanlis, Ines; Paul, Rachel; Kmita, Marie] Inst Rech Clin Montreal, Genet & Dev Res Unit, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada; [Desanlis, Ines; Kmita, Marie] Univ Montreal, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Paul, Rachel; Kmita, Marie] McGill Univ, Dept Expt Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada",Institut de Recherche Clinique de Montreal (IRCM); Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; McGill University,"Kmita, M (corresponding author), Inst Rech Clin Montreal, Genet & Dev Res Unit, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada.;Kmita, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.;Kmita, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Expt Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada.",Ines.Desanlis@ircm.qc.ca; Racheal.Paul@ircm.qc.ca; Marie.Kmita@ircm.qc.ca,"kmita, marie/AAU-9620-2020","Paul, Rachel/0000-0002-1421-0637",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [PJT-162143]; IRCM-Jean Coutu fellowship,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); IRCM-Jean Coutu fellowship,"This research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, grant number PJT-162143.

This work aimed to develop an iPSC organoid model enriched with NKX2-1(+) BTP-like cells. Building on previous studies, we optimized a directed differentiation paradigm to generate spheroids with more robust NKX2-1 expression. Spheroids were expanded into organoids that possessed NKX2-1(+)/CPM+ BTP-like cells, which increased in number over time. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a high degree of transcriptional similarity between induced BTPs (iBTPs) and in vivo BTPs. Using FACS, iBTPs were purified and expanded as induced bud tip progenitor organoids (iBTOs), which maintained an enriched population of bud tip progenitors. When iBTOs were directed to differentiate into airway or alveolar cell types using well-established methods, they gave rise to organoids composed of organized airway or alveolar epithelium, respectively. Collectively, iBTOs are transcriptionally and functionally similar to in vivo BTPs, providing an important model for studying human lung development and differentiation.","[Hein, Renee F.

Commuting patterns are highly linked to the spatial structure of functional districts in a city, which is substantially influenced by public transportation systems. Understanding urban mobility patterns are significant for revealing actual living districts and planning efficient transportation systems and infrastructure. This study aims to detect urban communities with spatially strong interaction based on similar mobility patterns. To extract homogeneous urban communities, we utilize a network community detection method, focusing on the multimodal transfer travels of the public transport system. As a case study, we examined urban communities in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea. The results showed newly detected living communities based on the actual mobility patterns of urban populations including multiple-choice behavior of transport mode. Such empirical findings depict more realistic dynamics of populations in large metropolitan areas and the significant influence of public transportation systems on urban mobility patterns.","[Kim, Jiwoo; Lee, Gunhak] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak-ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Gunhak] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Korean Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, G (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak-ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",gunhlee@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,61,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0160-0176,1552-6925,,INT REGIONAL SCI REV,Int.

Networks appear naturally in many fields of science and are often inherently complex structures. Many complex networks show signs of modular structure, uncovered by community detection. Communities allow researchers to understand better the network by reducing its complexity. This study analyzes the inter-regional commuting systems of the Attica Region in Greece, employing the approach of detection of complex network communities. In particular, in this paper, the administrative units of Attica are presented as a complex network, using the daily commuting as a criterion for the existence of a functional relationship and the identification of network communities (Functional Urban Areas). Network communities are identified through the modularity maximization method used to analyze complex networks. In parallel with this, through regression model application, the main factors affecting the out-commuting intensity of the municipalities of Attica are defined. The conclusions reached are of special interest to urban planning and especially to Greece, as commuting in this country has not been studied yet extensively.","[Stefanouli, Maria; Polyzos, Serafeim] Univ Thessaly, Sch Engn, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Stefanouli, M (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Sch Engn, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Greece.",mstefanouli@gmail.com; spolyzos@uth.gr,,,,,,,54,0,0,1,10,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,APR,2020,13.0,1,,,,,21,40,,10.6092/1970-9870/6280,0.0,,,20,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,LK5KP,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000530905400003,0,Urban Studies

In this paper, we investigated the patterns of intercity patient mobility and factors influencing this behavior based on >4 million hospitalization records of patients with chronic kidney disease in China. To provide practical policy recommendations, a role identification framework informed by complex network theory was proposed considering the strength and distribution of connections of cities in mobility networks. Such a mobility network features multiscale community structure with universal administrative constraints and a few boundary breaches. We discovered that cross-module visits which accounted for only 20 % of total visits, accounted for >50 % of the total travel distance. The explainable machine learning modeling results revealed that distance has a power-law-like effect on flow volume, and highquality healthcare resources are an important driving factor.

This process of DMAs creation is characterized by two stages: the partitioning of the system and the allocation of control devices. However, improving the management of supply networks is often only possible through the optimal allocation and operation of control devices in the pipelines. In this sense, this study proposes the implementation of different DMAs configurations with objective of costs, pressures, and water age minimization. For this work, hybrid algorithms are developed, consisting of the partitioning algorithms already established in the literature, Fast-Greedy and Louvain, and of the optimization algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The hybrid algorithms were implemented in the Python and Matlab programming languages. In this study, the Modena benchmark network has been used as a case study and the establishing DMAs have been made for single-objective optimizations. The results obtained are compared by analyzing hydraulic criteria, cost, modularity (connectivity) and frequency of valves allocated to the pipes. In general, the hybrid algorithms formed by Louvain algorithm obtained the best results.","[Anchieta, Thomaz Felipe de Freitas; Meirelles, Gustavo; Brentan, Bruno Melo] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Anchieta, TFD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.",thomazfelipe94@ufmg.br; gustavo.meirelles@ehr.ufmg.br; brentan@ehr.ufmg.br,,"Felipe de Freitas Anchieta, Thomaz/0000-0003-1792-3111",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil - Finance Code 001.,,69,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

This paper presents an optimisation procedure placing pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) to minimise the water losses of real-life water distribution networks (WDNs). The number and placement of the valves are optimised from clustering perspective with the Leiden algorithm. The optimal settings of the valves are determined with a differential evolution algorithm, where a compound fitness function is applied. On the one hand, it minimises the leakages, on the other hand, evades the pressure-dependent consumer outages, i.e. it keeps the pressure above the desired. Seven real-life water distribution networks were analysed from the region of Western Hungary using the techniques. Moreover, three of them are analysed in details.

In this article we present a novel approach to partition road networks through network modularity to produce data-driven static traffic assignment models from loop detector data on large road systems. The use of partitioning allows the estimation of the key model input of Origin-Destination demand matrices from flow counts alone. Previous network tomography-based demand estimation techniques have been limited by the network size. The amount of partitioning changes the Origin-Destination estimation optimisation problems to different levels of computational difficulty. Different approaches to utilising the partitioning were tested, one which degenerated the road network to the scale of the partitions and others which left the network intact. Applied to a subnetwork of England's Strategic Road Network and other test networks, our results for the degenerate case showed flow and travel time errors are reasonable with a small amount of degeneration. The results for the non-degenerate cases showed that similar errors in model prediction with lower computation requirements can be obtained when using large partitions compared with the non-partitioned case. This work could be used to improve the effectiveness of national road systems planning and infrastructure models.","[Roocroft, Alexander; Punzo, Giuliano] Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England; [Roocroft, Alexander; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore",University of Sheffield; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC),"Roocroft, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England.;Roocroft, A (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore.",aroocroft1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Ramli, Muhamad/AAE-2157-2019","Roocroft, Alexander/0000-0002-6551-1800; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar/0000-0002-6321-0828","The authors would like to express their thanks to the University of Sheffield and the Agency for Science, Technology amp; Research (A*STAR) under the A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP) for funding this project.

The number and placement of the valves are optimised from clustering perspective with the Leiden algorithm. The optimal settings of the valves are determined with a differential evolution algorithm, where a compound fitness function is applied. On the one hand, it minimises the leakages, on the other hand, evades the pressure-dependent consumer outages, i.e. it keeps the pressure above the desired. Seven real-life water distribution networks were analysed from the region of Western Hungary using the techniques. Moreover, three of them are analysed in details.

Therefore, contractors urgently need to accurately understand the competitive environment in which they will operate. In construction, few empirical studies exist on competitive environments from the standpoint of enterprise-to-enterprise competitive interactions. Based on market commonality, several hypotheses concerning the competitive pattern of the construction market have been proposed. To test these, a model of competing relationship networks is created using 7402 bid-winner notices for construction projects in Chongqing, China, from 2015 to 2018, followed by quantitative analysis and discussion of the model's characteristic features. The findings suggest that there is a community-type  rivalry in the building market, which represents the essential characteristics of market commonality. The research shows that the competitive action of construction enterprises is affected by construction technology, industrial division of labor and regional markets, and the competitive relationship between them tends to be strong-strong . This study reveals that the community  competitive relationship in the construction industry may be a unique phenomenon, expands the application and development of market commonality and enterprise clusters in the construction economy, and provides theoretical guidance for construction enterprises to accurately recognize competitive behavior and decision making.","[Chen, Keda; Ye, Kunhui] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Ye, KH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",chenkeda@cqu.edu.cn; Kunhui_YE@cqu.edu.cn,,"keda, chen/0000-0002-4066-1351; Ye, Kunhui/0000-0003-3734-3448",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871033],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"FundingThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71871033.",,64,1,1,1,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,OCT,2021,11.0,10,,,,,,,435,10.3390/buildings11100435,0.0,,,14,"Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,WP3FC,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000713020900001,0,"Engineering, Civil"

Categorization of M&A is important to both corporate strategy and academic research. Previous research largely uses case studies and econometric data analysis to classify the motivations and types of M&A. Here, we propose understanding M&A using large-scale data to generate more applicable and generalized results. We use transaction relationships from transaction networks to better understand M&A. Based on detailed pre-analysis, including matching M&A and transaction data from Japan and clustering of transaction networks, we select several M&A observation perspectives. We use two features of transaction networks to categorize M&A cases: betweenness centrality and shortest path length. Betweenness centrality provides a view of the overall business situation from a macro perspective, and shortest path length helps to understand neighboring business environments from a micro perspective. We find several meaningful areas of concentration based on their betweenness centrality values and shortest path lengths. Finally, we reexamine M&A cases in each area, summarizing the trends identified using this categorization method. This study contributes to the M&A literature because it advances quantitative categorization of M&A cases.","[Shao, Bohua; Asatani, Kimitaka; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Sasaki, Hajime; Sakata, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Shao, BH (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",shaobohua6@gmail.com,"Ichiro, Sakata/GWM-7823-2022; Sasaki, Hajime/AEB-0480-2022","Shao, Bohua/0000-0003-1489-6226; Sasaki, Hajime/0000-0003-0026-4076; Asatani, Kimitaka/0000-0003-3595-8940",,,,,45,5,5,4,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0275-5319,1878-3384,,RES INT BUS FINANC,Res.

This graph analysis method projects a semantic value onto a given coordinated syntactic dependency and constructs a second-order lexical network of lexical collocates with a high co-occurrence measure. The subsequent process of clustering and pruning the graph reveals lexical communities with high conceptual similarity, which are interpreted as associated senses of the source lexeme. We demonstrate the theory and its application to the task of identifying the conceptual structure and different meanings of nouns, adjectives and verbs using examples from different corpora, and explain the modulating effects of linguistic and graph parameters. This graph approach is based on syntactic dependency processing and can be used as a complementary method to other contemporary natural language processing resources to enrich semantic tasks such as word disambiguation, domain relatedness, sense structure, identification of synonymy, metonymy, and metaphoricity, as well as to automate comprehensive meta-reasoning about languages and identify cross/intra-cultural discourse variations of prototypical conceptualization patterns and knowledge representations.

Using bibliometric data from 2007 to 2018 in environmental engineering, 20 research communities were identified and two major drivers of scientific collaboration were revealed: research interest and country of one's affiliation. We developed a novel methodology that enables tracking cluster's evolutionary patterns. This methodology allowed systematic stereotyping of each cluster as mature  or emerging . The two stereotypes did not show a significant difference in the annual growth rate of the volume of publications, implying that comparable attention has been paid to advancing the knowledge of formerly-established subjects and exploring innovative subjects of environmental engineering.","[Park, Jaebeom; Choi, Yongju] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Jeryang] Hongik Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea; [Choi, Yongju] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Construct & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Hongik University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Choi, Y (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",ychoi81@snu.ac.kr,"Park, Jeryang/M-2031-2016","Park, Jeryang/0000-0002-9682-5669; Park, Jaebeom/0000-0001-6512-1821",BK21 Four research program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Min-istry of Science and ICT [NRF-2019R1C1C1008017],"BK21 Four research program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Min-istry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This paper relied on Web of Science (WOS) database supplied by the Clarivate Analytics.

This process of DMAs creation is characterized by two stages: the partitioning of the system and the allocation of control devices. However, improving the management of supply networks is often only possible through the optimal allocation and operation of control devices in the pipelines. In this sense, this study proposes the implementation of different DMAs configurations with objective of costs, pressures, and water age minimization. For this work, hybrid algorithms are developed, consisting of the partitioning algorithms already established in the literature, Fast-Greedy and Louvain, and of the optimization algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The hybrid algorithms were implemented in the Python and Matlab programming languages. In this study, the Modena benchmark network has been used as a case study and the establishing DMAs have been made for single-objective optimizations. The results obtained are compared by analyzing hydraulic criteria, cost, modularity (connectivity) and frequency of valves allocated to the pipes. In general, the hybrid algorithms formed by Louvain algorithm obtained the best results.","[Anchieta, Thomaz Felipe de Freitas; Meirelles, Gustavo; Brentan, Bruno Melo] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Anchieta, TFD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Engn Sch, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.",thomazfelipe94@ufmg.br; gustavo.meirelles@ehr.ufmg.br; brentan@ehr.ufmg.br,,"Felipe de Freitas Anchieta, Thomaz/0000-0003-1792-3111",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - (CAPES) Brazil - Finance Code 001.,,69,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

Selecting which unit operations to combine into an intensified unit is necessary in developing an intensified process that offers an inherently safer design with reduced energy demand. This paper presents a novel methodology to intensify a chemical process guided by modularity. A process network is decomposed into modules by applying a community detection algorithm to find the process units to be integrated into an intensified module to improve the Fire and Explosion Damage Index (FEDI). A case study for the separation of an ethanol-butanol-water mixture illustrates this approach. The results show that the safest design (lowest FEDI) is Alternative 1 which was developed using the approach and correlates with high modularity of 0.607. Energy use is reduced by 25.8% thus also leading to a more energy efficient process compared to the non-intensified design with a lower modularity (0.385). A rather empirically guided design was proposed as Alternative 2 which led to modularity of 0.533, but only 10% energy saving and no improvement in the FEDI. This demonstrates that intensification guided by modularity strengthens integration between the process units while improving both safety and energy efficiency. As such, the approach has a wide potential application to guide the intensification of chemical processes.","[Castillo-Landero, Arick; Aburto, Jorge; Martinez-Hernandez, Elias] Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Lazaro Cardenas 152, Mexico City 07730, Mexico; [Sadhukhan, Jhuma] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford GU2 7XH, England",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo; University of Surrey,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Lazaro Cardenas 152, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021","Sadhukhan, Jhuma/0000-0001-6791-1421; Castillo-Landero, Arick/0000-0002-4416-0896","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant [540821111]; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; British Council; [Y.62001]; NERC [NE/L014246/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; British Council(The British Council in India); ; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

Label propagation-based algorithms use local criteria and have a near-linear time complexity. However, these algorithms have problems such as low accuracy, instability, and high computational time in comparison with other local methods. This article presents a fast and simple label diffusion method (FSLD), using local criteria to discover communities accurately in large-scale networks. In FSLD method, community formation is initially started from a low-degree periphery node and then it diffuses its label from outer to inner side of community in a multi-level way. In next step, using a label updating step, all nodes from high-degree to low-degree have the potential to update and finalize their label to obtain initial communities. The experimental results reveal the higher accuracy and performance of the proposed FSLD algorithm in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms.","[Bouyer, Asgarali; Azad, Khatereh; Rouhi, Alireza] Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran",Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University,"Bouyer, A (corresponding author), Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Software Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",a.bouyer@azaruniv.ac.ir,"Bouyer, Asgarali/IYS-5116-2023; Rouhi, Alireza/L-2209-2018","Bouyer, Asgarali/0000-0002-4808-2856; Rouhi, Alireza/0000-0003-1494-3467",,,,,67,7,7,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-1079,1563-5104,,INT J GEN SYST,Int.

However, accurately identifying communities is challenging due to the complex nature of social networks. To address this challenge, we propose CD-BSO, an innovative metaheuristic based on brainstorming. CD-BSO leverages network knowledge through specialized initialization and solution generation operators designed to capture social network characteristics. In the initialization phase, a technique combining Depth-First Search (DFS) is employed to consider both connectivity and information diffusion, ensuring accurate community representation. The generation step introduces search operators that consider link formation and node similarity, facilitating convergence towards a community structure that closely resembles the network's actual structure. The evaluation of CD-BSO outperforms recent and well-known community detection methods. The evaluation results were further analyzed using visual analysis, providing valuable insights into the network structure. CD-BSO exhibits significant potential for accurately identifying communities and extracting meaningful information from social networks.","[Beldi, Zohra; Bessedik, Malika] Ecole Natl Super Informat Algiers ESI, Lab Methodes Concept Syst LMCS, Algiers, Algeria",,"Beldi, Z (corresponding author), Ecole Natl Super Informat Algiers ESI, Lab Methodes Concept Syst LMCS, Algiers, Algeria.",z_beldi@esi.dz,,,,,,,113,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-1079,1563-5104,,INT J GEN SYST,Int.

There is a lack of comprehensive and factual data-based analyses of e-scooter crashes and their causes. We collected 1936 crash-related reports over two years via the German press portal based on a systematic web content mining process. Sentiment analysis results revealed that the police reports' coverage is predominantly factual and neutral and, therefore, useful for keyword-based analyses. After identifying the 46 most relevant keywords in the reports, we generated an adjacency matrix to investigate the keywords' dependencies, visualized the network and dependencies of the most relevant keywords, and categorized them into four thematic clusters using the Louvain algorithm. Our results and findings reveal that driving under drug influence, especially alcohol, is one serious problem. Riding e-scooter in pairs and on forbidden terrain or in the wrong direction are also common causes of crashes. Consequences for e-scooter riders are severe injuries, driving license revocation, fines, criminal charges, and incurring for property damage. Further, wearing protective gear and helmets is of low acceptance among the e-scooter ridership. Based on our results and findings, we recommend e-scooter bans during the night times for some locations, obligatory driving tests before first e-scooter use, and helmet wearing.","[Brauner, Tim; Heumann, Maximilian; Kraschewski, Tobias; Prahlow, Oliver; Rehse, Jan; Kiehne, Christian; Breitner, Michael H.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Brauner, T (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Informat Syst Inst, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",brauner@iwi.uni-hannover.de,"; Heumann, Maximilian/JVN-5695-2024","Breitner, Michael/0000-0001-7315-3022; Brauner, Tim/0000-0003-3260-5015; Heumann, Maximilian/0000-0002-3765-7423",,,,,57,11,11,1,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0001-4575,1879-2057,,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,Accid.

It merges as a new way to provide a systematic view and complementary information of COVID-19 progression in the US, enabling evidence-based responses towards pandemic intervention and prevention. To begin with, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US. Then, relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics, which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics. Lastly, the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement, community detection, and online random forest, which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic. It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer (DER) are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution. Social factors regarding the political party, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network. Moreover, the cluster-specific predictor based on online random forest and sliding window is proven useful in dynamically capturing and predicting the epidemiological trends for each community, which can reach the highest.","[Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Unwin, Juliette] MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, London, England; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Taichung 413310, Taiwan; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Theoret & Appl Informat, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Nanyang Technological University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chaoyang University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Theoretical & Applied Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg; h.unwin@imperial.ac.uk,"Pan, Yue/KFS-4602-2024; Zhang, Limao/A-1320-2016","Unwin, Juliette/0000-0002-9120-4003","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore [04MNP000279C120, 04MNP002126C120]; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [04INS000423C120]","Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University)","This study is supported by the Ministry of Education Tier 1 Grants, Singapore (No. 04MNP000279C120, No. 04MNP002126C120) and the Start-Up Grant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (No. 04INS000423C120) .",,58,17,17,7,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Therefore, contractors urgently need to accurately understand the competitive environment in which they will operate. In construction, few empirical studies exist on competitive environments from the standpoint of enterprise-to-enterprise competitive interactions. Based on market commonality, several hypotheses concerning the competitive pattern of the construction market have been proposed. To test these, a model of competing relationship networks is created using 7402 bid-winner notices for construction projects in Chongqing, China, from 2015 to 2018, followed by quantitative analysis and discussion of the model's characteristic features. The findings suggest that there is a community-type  rivalry in the building market, which represents the essential characteristics of market commonality. The research shows that the competitive action of construction enterprises is affected by construction technology, industrial division of labor and regional markets, and the competitive relationship between them tends to be strong-strong . This study reveals that the community  competitive relationship in the construction industry may be a unique phenomenon, expands the application and development of market commonality and enterprise clusters in the construction economy, and provides theoretical guidance for construction enterprises to accurately recognize competitive behavior and decision making.","[Chen, Keda; Ye, Kunhui] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Ye, KH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",chenkeda@cqu.edu.cn; Kunhui_YE@cqu.edu.cn,,"keda, chen/0000-0002-4066-1351; Ye, Kunhui/0000-0003-3734-3448",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871033],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"FundingThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71871033.",,64,1,1,1,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,OCT,2021,11.0,10,,,,,,,435,10.3390/buildings11100435,0.0,,,14,Construction & Building Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,WP3FC,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000713020900001,0,Construction & Building Technology

To measure the hub performance of the airports, their binary betweenness centrality was compared with a weighted betweenness measure employing the ratio of geographical distance to passenger traffic between the nodes. A significant difference was observed between the two centrality measures.","[Ersoz, Cem] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Aviat & Aeronaut Sci, Orman Sk 13, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Ersoz, Cem; Karaman, Filiz] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Istanbul, Turkiye",Ozyegin University; Yildiz Technical University,"Ersöz, C (corresponding author), Ozyegin Univ, Fac Aviat & Aeronaut Sci, Orman Sk 13, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkiye.;Ersöz, C (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Istanbul, Turkiye.",cem.ersoz@ozyegin.edu.tr,"; Karaman, Filiz/C-7989-2014","Ersoz, Cem/0000-0001-8010-5205; Karaman, Filiz/0000-0002-8491-674X",,,,,44,3,3,8,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-1060,1029-0354,,TRANSPORT PLAN TECHN,Transp.

In this article we present a novel approach to partition road networks through network modularity to produce data-driven static traffic assignment models from loop detector data on large road systems. The use of partitioning allows the estimation of the key model input of Origin-Destination demand matrices from flow counts alone. Previous network tomography-based demand estimation techniques have been limited by the network size. The amount of partitioning changes the Origin-Destination estimation optimisation problems to different levels of computational difficulty. Different approaches to utilising the partitioning were tested, one which degenerated the road network to the scale of the partitions and others which left the network intact. Applied to a subnetwork of England's Strategic Road Network and other test networks, our results for the degenerate case showed flow and travel time errors are reasonable with a small amount of degeneration. The results for the non-degenerate cases showed that similar errors in model prediction with lower computation requirements can be obtained when using large partitions compared with the non-partitioned case. This work could be used to improve the effectiveness of national road systems planning and infrastructure models.","[Roocroft, Alexander; Punzo, Giuliano] Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England; [Roocroft, Alexander; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore",University of Sheffield; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC),"Roocroft, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept ACSE, Sheffield, England.;Roocroft, A (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore.",aroocroft1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Ramli, Muhamad/AAE-2157-2019","Roocroft, Alexander/0000-0002-6551-1800; Ramli, Muhamad Azfar/0000-0002-6321-0828","The authors would like to express their thanks to the University of Sheffield and the Agency for Science, Technology amp; Research (A*STAR) under the A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP) for funding this project.

These host-microbiome interactions may spatially vary along the physical and chemical environment of the intestine, but these changes remain unknown. This study investigated these intricate relationships through a gene co-expression network analysis based on dual transcriptome profiling of different intestinal sites-cecum, transverse colon, and rectum-of the primate common marmoset. We proposed a gene module extraction algorithm based on the graph theory to find tightly interacting gene modules of the host and the microbiome from a vast co-expression network. The 27 gene modules identified by this method, which include both host and microbiome genes, not only produced results consistent with previous studies regarding the host-microbiome relationships, but also provided new insights into microbiome genes acting as potential mediators in host-microbiome interplays. Specifically, we discovered associations between the host gene FBP1, a cancer marker, and polysaccharide degradation-related genes (pfkA and fucI) coded by Bacteroides vulgatus, as well as relationships between host B cell-specific genes (CD19, CD22, CD79B, and PTPN6) and a tryptophan synthesis gene (trpB) coded by Parabacteroides distasonis. Furthermore, our proposed module extraction algorithm surpassed existing approaches by successfully defining more functionally related gene modules, providing insights for understanding the complex relationship between the host and the microbiome. IMPORTANCE We unveiled the intricate dynamics of the host-microbiome interactions along the colon by identifying closely interacting gene modules from a vast gene co-expression network, constructed based on simultaneous profiling of both host and microbiome transcriptomes. Our proposed gene module extraction algorithm, designed to interpret inter-species interactions, enabled the identification of functionally related gene modules encompassing both host and microbiome genes, which was challenging with conventional modularity maximization algorithms. Through these identified gene modules, we discerned previously unrecognized bacterial genes that potentially mediate in known relationships between host genes and specific bacterial species. Our findings underscore the spatial variations in host-microbiome interactions along the colon, rather than displaying a uniform pattern throughout the colon.

Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing and functional studies to interrogate the impact of this pro-autoimmune allele on anti-viral immunity during Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus clone 13 (LCMV-cl13) infection. Mice homozygous for this allele (PEP-619WW) clear the LCMV-cl13 virus whereas wildtype (PEP-WT) mice cannot. This is associated with enhanced anti-viral CD4 T cell responses and a more immunostimulatory CD8 alpha- cDC phenotype. Adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that PEP-619WW enhanced anti-viral CD4 T cell function through virus-specific CD4 T cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Taken together, our data show that the pro-autoimmune allele of Ptpn22 drives a beneficial anti-viral immune response thereby preventing what is normally a chronic virus infection.","[Orozco, Robin C.; Marquardt, Kristi; Pratumchai, Isaraphorn; Mowen, Kerri; Teijaro, John R.; Sherman, Linda A.] Scripps Res, Dept Immunol & Microbiol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Orozco, Robin C.; Shaikh, Anam Fatima] Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Domissy, Alain] Scripps Res, Genom Core, La Jolla, CA USA",Scripps Research Institute; University of Kansas; Scripps Research Institute,"Orozco, RC; Sherman, LA (corresponding author), Scripps Res, Dept Immunol & Microbiol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;Orozco, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",Orozco.robin@ku.edu; lsherman@scripps.edu,,"Orozco, Robin/0000-0002-2138-2912","National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM113117]; NIH [U01 AI130842, T32 AI007354 27]",National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health under award number P20GM113117 (awarded to R.C.O, while at University of Kansas) and NIH U01 AI130842 (awarded to L.A.S) and NIH T32 AI007354 27 (fellowship to support R.C.O, while at Scripps).

Identifying the most influential spreaders in networks is vital to controlling and understanding the spreading process of infectious diseases. We used Baidu Migration data for the whole year of 2021 to build mobility networks. The nodes of the network represent cities, and the edges represent the population flow be-tween cities. By applying the k-shell decomposition and the Louvain algorithm, we could get the k-shell values for each city and community partition. Then, we identified the most efficient nodes or pathways in a complex network by generating random networks. Furthermore, we analyzed the eigenvalue of the migration matrix to find the nodes that have the most impact on the network. We also found the consistency between k-shell value and eigenvalue through Kendall's T test. The main result is that in Spring Festival and National Day, the network is at higher risk of an infectious disease outbreak and the Yangtze River Delta is at the highest risk of an epidemic all year around. Shanghai is the most significant node in both k-shell value and eigenvalue analysis. The spatiotemporal property of the network should be taken into account to model the transmission of infectious diseases more accurately.(c) 2023 The Authors.

However, HIV-1-infected cells are extremely heterogeneous and rare. Single-cell multiomic approaches resolve the heterogeneity and rarity of HIV-1-infected cells.Recent findingsAdvancement in single-cell multiomic approaches enabled HIV-1 reservoir profiling across the epigenetic (ATAC-seq), transcriptional (RNA-seq), and protein levels (CITE-seq). Using HIV-1 RNA as a surrogate, ECCITE-seq identified enrichment of HIV-1-infected cells in clonally expanded cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells. Using HIV-1 DNA PCR-activated microfluidic sorting, FIND-seq captured the bulk transcriptome of HIV-1 DNA+ cells. Using targeted HIV-1 DNA amplification, PheP-seq identified surface protein expression of intact versus defective HIV-1-infected cells. Using ATAC-seq to identify HIV-1 DNA, ASAP-seq captured transcription factor activity and surface protein expression of HIV-1 DNA+ cells. Combining HIV-1 mapping by ATAC-seq and HIV-1 RNA mapping by RNA-seq, DOGMA-seq captured the epigenetic, transcriptional, and surface protein expression of latent and transcriptionally active HIV-1-infected cells. To identify reproducible biological insights and authentic HIV-1-infected cells and avoid false-positive discovery of artifacts, we reviewed current practices of single-cell multiomic experimental design and bioinformatic analysis.Single-cell multiomic approaches may identify innovative mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence, nominate therapeutic strategies, and accelerate discoveries.","[Wong, Michelle; Wei, Yulong; Ho, Ya-Chi] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis, New Haven, CT USA; [Ho, Ya-Chi] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Ho, YC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",ya-chi.ho@yale.edu,"Wei, Yulong/IWV-1115-2023",,"NIH [R01 AI141009, R01 AI174863, R61/R33 DA047037, P01 AI169768, R37 AI147868, R01 DA051906, R01 AI145164, UM1 DA051410, U01 DA053628, P50 AI150464, UM1 AI164565, UM1 UM1 AI164570]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [PDF557234]; AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant,"This work is supported by Yale Top Scholar, NIH R01 AI141009, NIH R01 AI174863, NIH R61/R33 DA047037, NIH P01 AI169768, NIH R37 AI147868, NIH R01 DA051906, NIH R01 AI145164, NIH UM1 DA051410, NIH U01 DA053628, NIH CHEETAH P50 AI150464, NIH REACH Martin Delaney Collaboratory UM1 AI164565, NIH BEAT-HIV Martin Delaney Collaboratory UM1 UM1 AI164570, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-doctoral Fellowship (PDF557234) (Y.W.), AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource Pilot (ACSR) Grant (Y.W.).",,103,2,3,6,23,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1746-630X,1746-6318,,CURR OPIN HIV AIDS,Curr.

Clustering, which can be used for classification, presents opportunities for identifying hard-to-reach groups for the development of customized health interventions. Due to a desire to convert abundant DNA gene co-expression data into networks, many graph inference methods have been developed. Likewise there are many clustering and classification tools. This paper presents a comparison of techniques for graph inference and clustering, using different numbers of features, in order to select the best tuple of graph inference method, clustering method, and number of features according to a particular phenotype. An extensive machine learning based analysis of the REGARDS dataset is conducted, evaluating the CoNet and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) network inference methods, along with the Louvain, Leiden and NBR-Clust clustering techniques. Results from analysis involving five internal cluster evaluation indices show the traditional KNN inference method and NBR-Clust and Louvain clustering produce the most promising clusters with medical phenotype data. It is also shown that visualization can aid in interpreting the clusters, and that the clusters produced can identify meaningful groups indicating customized interventions.","[Kramer, Jordan; Boone, Lyric; Clifford, Thomas; Bruce, Justin; Matta, John] Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Matta, J (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",jkramer@siue.edu; lyboone@siue.edu; tcliffo@siue.edu; jubruce@siue.edu; jmatta@siue.edu,,"Matta, John/0000-0002-7666-1409; Boone, Lyric/0000-0001-5161-0587",,,,,48,8,11,0,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2194,2168-2208,,IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH,IEEE J.

Single-cell sequencing technology provides substantial prospects to gain an in-depth understanding of the cellular phenotypic variability driving tumor progression. A comprehensive insight into the intra-tumor heterogeneity may further assist in dealing with the treatment-resistant clones in cancer patients, thereby improving their overall survival. However, this task is hampered due to the challenges associated with the single-cell data, such as false positives, false negatives and missing bases, and the increase in their size. As a result, the computational cost of the existing methods increases, thereby limiting their usage. In this work, we propose a robust graph learning-based method, ARCANE-ROG (Algorithm for Reconstruction of CANcer Evolution via RObust Graph learning), for inferring clonal evolution from single-cell datasets. The first step of the proposed method is a joint framework of denoising with data imputation for the noisy and incomplete matrix while simultaneously learning an adjacency graph. Both the operations in the joint framework boost each other such that the overall performance of the denoising algorithm is improved. In the second step, an optimal number of clusters are identified via the Leiden method. In the last step, clonal evolution trees are inferred via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The method has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, RobustClone, using simulated datasets of varying sizes and five real datasets. The performance of our proposed method is found to be significantly superior (p-value < 0.05) in terms of reconstruction error, False Positive to False Negative (FPFN) ratio, tree distance error and V-measure compared to the other method. Overall, the proposed method is an improvement over the existing methods as it enhances cluster assignment and inference on clonal hierarchies.","[Farswan, Akanksha; Gupta, Anubha] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Dept ECE, SBILab, New Delhi, India; [Gupta, Ritu] AIIMS, Dr BRA IRCH, Lab Oncol Unit, New Delhi, India",Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; DR.

Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.","[Honnorat, Nicolas; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Saranathan, Manojkumar] Univ Arizona, Dept Med Imaging, Coll Med, 1501 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Sullivan, Edith, V; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",SRI International; University of Arizona; Stanford University,"Zahr, NM (corresponding author), SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;Zahr, NM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicolas.honnorat@sri.com; manojsar@radiology.arizona.edu; dolfp@stanford.edu; kilian.pohl@stanford.edu; nzahr@stanford.edu,"Saranathan, Manojkumar/O-4353-2019; Sullivan, Edith/ABD-5684-2021; Zahr, Natalie/W-5292-2019; Zahr, Natalie/L-7692-2016","Zahr, Natalie/0000-0002-3346-4894; Saranathan, Manoj/0000-0001-9020-9948; Pohl, Kilian/0000-0001-5416-5159; Sullivan, Edith/0000-0001-6739-3716","National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH113406]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH113406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [U01AA017347] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),"This study was supported with grant funding from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723, and National Institute of Mental Health: R01 MH113406.",,114,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0376-8716,1879-0046,,DRUG ALCOHOL DEPEN,Drug Alcohol Depend.,MAR 1,2021,220.0,,,,,,,,108509,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108509,0.0,,JAN 2021,10,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,QK3QW,33453503.0,Green Accepted,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000620296200008,0,Substance Abuse

Current provider-focused interventions are implemented at the federal, state, regional, and local levels but have not slowed the epidemic. Certain targeted interventions aimed at opioid prescribers rely on populations defined along geographic, political, or administrative boundaries; however, those boundaries may not align well with actual provider-patient communities or with the geographic distribution of high-risk opioid use. Instead of relying exclusively on commonly used geographic and administrative boundaries, we suggest augmenting existing strategies with a social network-based approach to identify communities (or clusters) of providers that prescribe to the same set of patients as another mechanism for targeting certain interventions. To test this approach, we analyze 1 year of prescription data from a commercially insured population in the state of Indiana. The composition of inferred clusters is compared to Indiana's Public Health Preparedness Districts (PHPDs). We find that in some cases the correspondence between provider networks and PHPDs is very high, while in other cases the overlap is low. This has implications for whether an intervention is reaching its intended provider targets efficiently and effectively. Assessing the best intervention targeting strategy for a particular outcome could facilitate more effective interventions to tackle the ongoing opioid use epidemic.","[Kaminski, Patrick; Perry, Brea L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Green Jr, Harold D.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kaminski, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA.;Kaminski, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA.",pckamins@indiana.edu,"Green, Harold/IXX-0651-2023","Kaminski, Patrick/0000-0002-2009-9170","Special thanks to Alexander Gates for helpful discussions of the clustering similarity method, S.

To leverage the full potential of roadside 4D MMW radars, an innovative traffic detection method is proposed based on their distinctive data characteristics. First, velocity-based filtering and region of interest (ROI) extraction were employed to filter and associate point data by merging the point cloud frames to enhance the point relationship. Then, the Louvain algorithm was used to divide the graph into modularity by converting the point cloud data into graph structure and amplifying the differences with the Gaussian kernel function. Finally, a detection augmentation method is introduced to address the problems of over-clustering and under-clustering based on the object ID characteristics of 4D MMW radar data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method obtained the highest average precision and F1 score: 98.15% and 98.58%, respectively.

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.","[Liu, Qiliang; Hou, Zhaoyi; Yang, Jie] Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Dept Geo Informat, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jie_yang@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41971353, 41730105]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ20058, 2020JJ4695]; water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province [KT202110, KT202002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded through support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 41971353 and 41730105), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2021JJ20058 and 2020JJ4695), and the water conservancy science and technology project of Guizhou Province (No. KT202110 and KT202002).",,43,1,1,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4144,10.3390/rs14174144,0.0,,,20,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4K1ZE,,gold,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000851756200001,0,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"

Recent advancements in 3D vertical interconnection technology have enabled 3D interconnections with reduced area overhead, potentially enhancing 3D IC performance in terms of timing, power, yield, and cost. However, despite the increased inter-die connection capacity enabled by fine-pitch 3D vias, research on 3D IC partitioning methods for timing improvement remains insufficient. This paper proposes a partitioning and placement method that optimizes the timing of 3D ICs by leveraging the increased inter-die connection capacity provided by fine pitch 3D vias. By using the Leiden algorithm and unsupervised GNN, we achieve optimal partitioning without relying on the results of 2D placement or additional training data. Our method employs balanced COP-KMeans to incorporate critical path optimization into partitioning, while ensuring balanced cell allocation across dies, thereby maximizing the area benefits of 3D ICs. Additionally, we optimize the timing of 3D ICs through 3D cell placement with critical net weight adjustments and a novel 3D via placement approach that differs from traditional 3D Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL) optimization perspectives.","[Kim, Donggyu; Hur, Junseok; Lee, Jakang; Cho, Jinoh; Kang, Seokhyeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Kim, Minjae] Baum Design Syst Co, Seoul, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kim, D (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",gyu511@postech.ac.kr,,"LEE, JAKANG/0009-0004-0010-9863; Kang, Seokhyeong/0000-0003-3015-1806","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [RS-2023-00222085, RS-2023-00222609]","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. RS-2023-00222085, Development of memory module and memory compiler for non-volatile PIM and No. RS-2023-00222609, Development of thermal modelling and heat-spreading architecture for heterogeneous integrating package of AI chiplets).",,27,1,1,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0699-8,,,,2024,,,,,,,,,19,10.1145/3670474.3685957,0.0,,,7,"Engineering, Manufacturing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BX7NJ,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001323675100019,0,"Engineering, Manufacturing"

To correctly predict routing congestion, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) has gained great attention. However, existing GNN-based methods have limitations in capturing crucial netlist information and effectively representing complex topologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach, ClusterNet, to predict routing congestion caused by netlist topology. Our approach leverages netlist clustering to overcome these limitations. We first divide the netlist into highly connected clusters using the Leiden algorithm, enabling an analysis of the local netlist topology. We then predict routing congestion by exploiting GNNs to generate cluster embeddings that capture the detailed netlist topology. In addition, we introduce a cluster padding method that utilizes the trained model to mitigate routing congestion. By applying the proposed ClusterNet, we can accurately predict and optimize routing congestion from specific cluster topologies. Our experimental results demonstrated improved prediction performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.056 and an R2 score of 0.669. Furthermore, routing congestion optimization significantly improved the total negative slack and reduced the number of failing endpoints by 14.5% and 9.9%, respectively.","[Min, Kyungjun; Kwon, Seongbin; Lee, Sung-Yun; Kim, Dohun; Park, Sunghye; Kang, Seokhyeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Min, K (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",kj.min@postech.ac.kr; sbkwon@postech.ac.kr; syun.lee@postech.ac.kr; dohunkim@postech.ac.kr; shpark96@postech.ac.kr; shkang@postech.ac.kr,"Lee, Sung-Yun/JDM-2887-2023","Park, Sunghye/0000-0002-1932-0763","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) [2019R1A5A1027055, 2020M3H2A107804514]; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) [RS-2023-00222085]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.(Samsung); Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A5A1027055, 2020M3H2A107804514), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and the Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant (No. RS-2023-00222085).",,32,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1933-7760,,979-8-3503-2225-5,ICCAD-IEEE ACM INT,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ICCAD57390.2023.10323942,0.0,,,9,"Engineering, Manufacturing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BW2HI,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:001116715100178,0,"Engineering, Manufacturing"

In this paper, we present a graph-based unsupervised semantic clustering method and a novel cluster matching technique, with a view to create a multi-layer semantic memory map robust to illumination changes. Using indoor data collected by an unmanned aerial robot (UAR) and a publicly available dataset, we apply a community detection algorithm (CDA) to find efficiently coherent visual data throughout the trajectory creating a semantic base map. Then, we optimize the formed communities using metric information by implementing an hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. The multilayer semantic map is created by constructing map instances for variant lighting conditions and matching the generated clusters to their base map correspondence. The proposed matching method relies on the graphs centrality indicators to identify central images of a region and utilize them to efficiently extract resemblances within the base map.","[Papapetros, Ioannis Tsampikos; Balaska, Vasiliki; Gasteratos, Antonios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Papapetros, IT (corresponding author), Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Prod & Management Engn, Vas Sophias 12, GR-67132 Xanthi, Greece.",,"Gasteratos, Antonios/AAI-4740-2021",,,,,,35,17,17,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2373-6720,,978-1-7281-4278-4,INT CONF UNMAN AIRCR,,,2020,,,,,,,1206.0,1212.0,,10.1109/icuas48674.2020.9213923,0.0,,,7,"Engineering, Aerospace",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,BQ6IY,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000612041300155,0,"Engineering, Aerospace"

This fragmentation, in unison with competing KPAs, leads to complex interdependencies between performance indicators, which results in an imbalance, with some of these indicators being penalized to the apparent benefit of others. Therefore, it is necessary to support ATM stakeholders in systematically uncovering hidden trade-offs between KPAs. Existing literature confirms this claim, but how to solve it has not been fully addressed. In this paper, we envision air traffic complexity to be the framework through which a common understanding among stakeholders is enhanced. We introduce the concept of single aircraft complexity to determine the contribution of each aircraft to the overall complexity of air traffic. Furthermore, we describe a methodology extending this concept to define complex communities, which are groups of interdependent aircraft that contribute the majority of the complexity in a certain airspace. Through use-cases based on synthetic and real historical traffic, we first show that the algorithm can serve to formalize and improve decision-making. Further, we illustrates how the provided information can be used to increase transparency of the decision makers towards different airspace users. In order to showcase the methodology, we develop a tool that visualizes different outputs of the algorithm. Lastly, we conduct sensitivity analysis in order to systematically analyse how each input affects the methodology.","[Isufaj, Ralvi; Omeri, Marsel; Piera, Miquel Angel; Valls, Jaume Saez] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Logist & Aeronaut Grp, Sabadell 08202, Spain; [Gallego, Christian Eduardo Verdonk] CRIDA AIE, Madrid 28022, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Isufaj, R (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Logist & Aeronaut Grp, Sabadell 08202, Spain.",ralvi.isufaj@uab.cat,"Piera, Miquel Angel/ABB-4197-2021; Verdonk, Christian/GLR-7121-2022","Omeri, Marsel/0000-0002-4547-3202; Isufaj, Ralvi/0000-0003-0839-3235; Verdonk Gallego, Christian Eduardo/0000-0003-0504-0143; Piera, Miquel Angel/0000-0002-7227-7944","CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM [783287]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [783287] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme","CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme)","This work was supported in part by the H2020 EngageKTN, grant agreement no. 783287, and CRIDA scholarship for research, development and innovation in ATM.",,29,4,4,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2226-4310,,AEROSPACE-BASEL,Aerospace,OCT,2022,9.0,10,,,,,,,613,10.3390/aerospace9100613,0.0,,,27,"Engineering, Aerospace",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,5R0QF,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000874224200001,0,"Engineering, Aerospace"

When applied to a complex chemical system whose varying chemical environments cause multiple time scale behavior, Delta-screening is able to resolve the multiple time scales of temporal communities.

Among others, this includes principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which aim to maximize the variance and the time scale of the first components, respectively. A crucial first step of such an analysis is the identification of suitable and relevant input coordinates (the so-called features), such as backbone dihedral angles and interresidue distances. As typically only a small subset of those coordinates is involved in a specific biomolecular process, it is important to discard the remaining uncorrelated motions or weakly correlated noise coordinates. This is because they may exhibit large amplitudes or long time scales and therefore will be erroneously considered important by PCA and TICA, respectively. To discriminate collective motions underlying functional dynamics from uncorrelated motions, the correlation matrix of the input coordinates is block-diagonalized by a clustering method. This strategy avoids possible bias due to presumed functional observables and conformational states or variation principles that maximize variance or time scales. Considering several linear and nonlinear correlation measures and various clustering algorithms, it is shown that the combination of linear correlation and the Leiden community detection algorithm yields excellent results for all considered model systems. These include the functional motion of T4 lysozyme to demonstrate the successful identification of collective motion, as well as the folding of the villin headpiece to highlight the physical interpretation of the correlated motions in terms of a functional mechanism.","[Diez, Georg; Nagel, Daniel; Stock, Gerhard] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Stock, G (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",stock@physik.uni-freiburg.de,,"Nagel, Daniel/0000-0002-2863-2646; Diez, Georg/0000-0002-4114-1577","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR 5099, 431945604, 37/935-1 FUGG]; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; bwUniCluster computing initiative; High Performance and Cloud Computing Group at the Zentrum fur Datenverarbeitung of the University of Tubingen,"The authors thank Matthias Post, Steffen Wolf, Sofia Sartore, and Marius Lange for fruitful discussions and D.

We design several quantum variants of a popular classical algorithm - the Louvain algorithm for community detection - and first study their complexities in the usual way, before analysing their complexities empirically across a variety of artificial and real inputs. We find that this analysis yields insights not available to us via the asymptotic analysis, further emphasising the utility in such an empirical approach. In particular, we observe that a complicated quantum algorithm with a large asymptotic speedup might not be the fastest algorithm in practice, and that a simple quantum algorithm with a modest speedup might in fact be the one that performs best. Moreover, we repeatedly find that overheads such as those arising from the need to amplify the success probabilities of quantum sub-routines such as Grover search can nullify any speedup that might have been suggested by a theoretical worst- or expected-case analysis.","[Cade, Chris; Folkertsma, Marten; Niesen, Ido; Weggemans, Jordi] QuSoft, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cade, Chris; Niesen, Ido] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Folkertsma, Marten; Weggemans, Jordi] CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cade, Chris] Fermioniq, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Cade, C (corresponding author), QuSoft, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Cade, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Cade, C (corresponding author), Fermioniq, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,"QuSoft [QuantAlgo 680-91-034]; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK), as part of the Quantum Delta NL programme; ABN AMRO; QuSoft; CWI [680-91-034]","QuSoft; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK), as part of the Quantum Delta NL programme; ABN AMRO; QuSoft; CWI","CC was supported by QuantERA project QuantAlgo 680-91-034, with further funding provided by QuSoft and CWI.

The objective of this work was to leverage information extracted from large databases to evaluate the consistency and validity of these subjective reports, and to determine their correlation with the reported cultivars and with estimates of their chemical composition (delta-9-THC, CBD, terpenes). Methods: We analyzed a large publicly available dataset extracted from Leafly.com where users freely reported their experiences with cannabis cultivars, including different subjective effects and flavour associations. This analysis was complemented with information on the chemical composition of a subset of the cultivars extracted from Psilabs.org. The structure of this dataset was investigated using network analysis applied to the pairwise similarities between reported subjective effects and/or chemical compositions. Random forest classifiers were used to evaluate whether reports of flavours and subjective effects could identify the labelled species cultivar. We applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to free narratives written by the users to validate the subjective effect and flavour tags. Finally, we explored the relationship between terpenoid content, cannabinoid composition and subjective reports in a subset of the cultivars. Results: Machine learning classifiers distinguished between species tags given by Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica based on the reported flavours: = 0.828 +/- 0.002 (p < 0.001); and effects: = 0.9965 +/- 0.0002 (p < 0.001). A significant relationship between terpene and cannabinoid content was suggested by positive correlations between subjective effect and flavour tags (p < 0.05, False-Discovery-rate (FDR)-corrected); these correlations clustered the reported effects into three groups that represented unpleasant, stimulant and soothing effects. The use of predefined tags was validated by applying latent semantic analysis tools to unstructured written reviews, also providing breed-specific topics consistent with their purported subjective effects. Terpene profiles matched the perceptual characterizations made by the users, particularly for the terpene-flavours graph (Q = 0.324). Conclusions: Our work represents the first data-driven synthesis of self-reported and chemical information in a large number of cannabis cultivars. Since terpene content is robustly inherited and less influenced by environmental factors, flavour perception could represent a reliable marker to indirectly characterize the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Our novel methodology helps meet demands for reliable cultivar characterization in the context of an ever-growing market for medicinal and recreational cannabis.","[de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Phys Inst IFIBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Phys, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia] Favaloro Univ, INECO Fdn, Inst Cognit & Translat Neurosci INCYT, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de la Fuente, Alethia; Zamberlan, Federico; Carrillo, Facundo; Tagliazucchi, Enzo; Pallavicini, Carla] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ferran, Andres Sanchez] Natl Univ Tucuman, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Carrillo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Appl Artificial Intelligence Lab, ICC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pallavicini, Carla] FLENI CONICET, Grp Invest Neurociencias Aplicadas & Alteraciones, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Phys Inst IFIBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Phys, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Pallavicini, C (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",krlitax@gmail.com,"Tagliazucchi, Enzo/F-3618-2019","Tagliazucchi, Enzo/0000-0003-0421-9993",CONICET,CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),AF and FZ were supported by a doctoral fellowship from CONICET.

As demonstrated by applications from numerous industry groups and interest from regulatory authorities, QSP is becoming an increasingly critical component in clinical drug development. With rapidly evolving computational tools and methods, QSP modeling has achieved important progress in pharmaceutical research and development, including for heart failure (HF). However, various challenges exist in the QSP modeling and clinical characterization of HF. Machine/deep learning (ML/DL) methods have had success in a wide variety of fields and disciplines.

The combination of ML/DL and QSP modeling becomes an emergent direction in the understanding of HF and clinical development new therapies.

The method itself is based on clustering methods and graph theory and uses only the spatial properties of points. Firstly, the point cloud is reduced to clusters with DBSCAN. Those clusters are connected to a 3D graph, and then graph partitioning and further refinements are applied to obtain the final segments. Multiple datasets were acquired for two test sites in the Czech Republic which are covered by commercial forest to evaluate the influence of laser scanning parameters and forest characteristics on segmentation results. The accuracy of segmentation was compared with manual labels collected on top of the orthophoto image and reached between 82 and 93% depending on the test site and laser scanning parameters. Additionally, an area-based approach was employed for validation using field-measured data, where the distribution of tree heights in plots was analyzed.","[Seidl, Jakub; Kacmarik, Michal] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Min & Geol, Dept Geoinformat, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic; [Klimanek, Martin] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Management & Appl Geoinformat, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Mendel University in Brno,"Kacmarik, M (corresponding author), VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Min & Geol, Dept Geoinformat, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic.",jakub.seidl@vsb.cz; michal.kacmarik@vsb.cz; martin.klimanek@mendelu.cz,"Kačmařík, Michal/J-9875-2016; Klimanek, Martin/H-8476-2012","Seidl, Jakub/0000-0003-4326-7816; Kacmarik, Michal/0000-0002-2352-3483; Klimanek, Martin/0000-0002-5401-7268","Faculty of Mining and Geology, VSB-Technical University, Ostrava [SP2024/057]; Internal Grant Agency FFWT MENDELU [LDF_TP_2021002]","Faculty of Mining and Geology, VSB-Technical University, Ostrava; Internal Grant Agency FFWT MENDELU","This work was partially supported by a grant SGS No. SP2024/057, from the Faculty of Mining and Geology, VSB-Technical University, Ostrava.

The contradictions between the goals and the concrete plans to increase production, processing, and consumption of forest biomass in Europe have however raised sustainability concerns within and beyond its borders. While political actors articulate such contradictions differently and compete for traction for their viewpoints in the public discourse, little is known about how citizens of urban areas perceive this discourse. Conceptualising perception as a multidimensional construct, data from eight European university cities (Bordeaux, Bratislava, Freiburg, Helsinki, Padua, St. Petersburg, Uppsala, Vienna) are statistically analysed to explore its dimensions, the communities of like-minded citizens forming across those dimensions, and the traits associating with membership in each such community. Five communities across six dimensions from biocentrism through distributional aspects to adherence to political goals are identified: adherent-environmentalist, adherent-governmentalist, critical-reformist, critical -agriculturalist, and indifferent. City of residence and perceived familiarity with bioeconomy clearly interact with perception. There is however considerable variation in communities within and across the eight cities, suggesting deeper social tension beyond the public discourse. Much of the within-community variation remains unexplained, though, calling for more work locally. Implications for forest policy are derived.","[Malkamaki, Arttu] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Korhonen, Jaana E.; Berghall, Sami; D'Amato, Dalia; Suomala, Tuuli; Toppinen, Anne; Valsta, Lauri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Malkamaki, Arttu; Korhonen, Jaana E.; D'Amato, Dalia; Toppinen, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Rustas, Carolina Berg; Mark-Herbert, Cecilia; Nagy, Emil] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Berno, Hanna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Carreira, Ariane] French Natl Inst Environm Res & Technol, Bordeaux, France; [Dobrovolsky, Alexander] St Petersburg State Forest Tech Univ, Dept Forestry, St Petersburg, Russia; [Giertliova, Blanka; Navratilova, Lenka; Vybostok, Jozef] Dept Econ & Management Forestry, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Holmgren, Sara] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden; [Masiero, Mauro; Secco, Laura] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy; [Puelzl, Helga] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Puelzl, Helga] European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Ranather, Lea] Wood K plus Competence Ctr Wood Composites & Wood, Linz, Austria; [Zellweger, Jonas] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany; [Korhonen, Jaana E.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Padua; BOKU University; University of Freiburg; Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education,"Malkamaki, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Malkamaki, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",arttu.malkamaki@helsinki.fi; jaana.e.korhonen@helsinki.fi; sami.berghall@helsinki.fi; hanna.berno@edu.se; ariane.carreira@irstea.fr; dalia.damato@helsinki.fi; blanka.giertliova@tuzvo.sk; holmgren@slu.se; sara.holmgren@slu.se; cecilia.mark-herbert@slu.se; mauro.masiero@unipd.it; emil.nagy@slu.se; lenka.navratilova@tuzvo.sk; helga.puelzl@boku.ac.at; l.ranacher@wood-kplus.at; laura.secco@unipd.it; anne.toppinen@helsinki.fi; lauri.valsta@helsinki.fi; jozef.vybostok@tuzvo.sk; jonas.zellweger@jupiter.uni-freiburg.de,"Marcineková, Lenka/ABH-1268-2020; Výbošťok, Jozef/AID-5754-2022; Masiero, Mauro/G-5186-2015; Puelzl, Helga/AAH-3500-2019; Giertliova, Blanka/AAN-7634-2021; D'Amato, Dalia/AAJ-6538-2020; Dobrovolsky, Alexander/ABF-7706-2020; Secco, Laura/B-6304-2012","Malkamaki, Arttu/0000-0002-7751-8831; Valsta, Lauri/0000-0002-7555-7271; Mark-Herbert, Cecilia/0000-0001-7440-9106; Korhonen, Jaana/0000-0001-9266-2260; Puelzl, Helga/0000-0001-7920-5903; Marcinekova, Lenka/0000-0003-2989-336X; Giertliova, Blanka/0000-0001-8794-9347; D'Amato, Dalia/0000-0002-3992-7263; Toppinen, Anne/0000-0003-0910-1505",Euro-pean Forest Institute (EFI); Kone Foundation [201805496]; FORMAS - the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development [942-2016-30]; FFG - the Austrian Research Promotion Agency [865905]; Strategic Research Council [335241],Euro-pean Forest Institute (EFI); Kone Foundation; FORMAS - the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; FFG - the Austrian Research Promotion Agency; Strategic Research Council,"We want to express our sincere gratitude to everybody who took part in the survey in one of the eight cities.

Study Design and Setting: Using cross-sectional self-reported data on 24 diseases from 30,097 community-living adults aged 45 e 85 from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we conducted network analyses using 5 clustering methods and 11 association measures commonly used in multimorbidity studies. We compared the similarity among clusters using the adjusted Rand index (ARI); an ARI of 0 is equivalent to the diseases being randomly assigned to clusters, and 1 indicates perfect agreement. We compared the network analysis results to disease clusters independently identified by two clinicians. Results: Results differed greatly across combinations of association measures and cluster algorithms. The number of clusters identified ranged from 1 to 24, with a low similarity of conditions within clusters. Compared to clinician-derived clusters, ARIs ranged from- 0.02 to 0.24, indicating little similarity. Conclusion: These analyses demonstrate the need for a systematic evaluation of the performance of network analysis methods on binary clustered data like diseases. Moreover, in individual older adults, diseases may not cluster predictably, highlighting the need for a personalized approach to their care. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

However, the limited understanding of the underlying pathological processes at the cellular and molecular level has hindered the development of comprehensive treatment options for these disorders. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biomedical research by enabling detailed examination of cellular and molecular diversity. Nevertheless, investigating mechanisms at the single-cell level in highly mineralized skeletal tissue poses technical challenges. In this comprehensive review, we present a streamlined approach to obtaining high-quality single cells from skeletal tissue and provide an overview of existing scRNA-seq technologies employed in skeletal studies along with practical bioinformatic analysis pipelines. By utilizing these methodologies, crucial insights into the developmental dynamics, maintenance of homeostasis, and pathological processes involved in spine, joint, bone, muscle, and tendon disorders have been uncovered. Specifically focusing on the joint diseases of degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis using scRNA-seq has provided novel insights and a more nuanced comprehension. These findings have paved the way for discovering novel therapeutic targets that offer potential benefits to patients suffering from diverse skeletal disorders.","[Lin, Peng; Gan, Yi-Bo; He, Jian; Zhu, Jun; Zhang, Liang; Huang, Sha; Hu, Ou; Wang, Ying-Bo; Jin, Huai-Jian; Li, Yang-Yang; Yan, Pu-Lin; Liu, Peng] Army Med Univ, Daping Hosp, Ctr Orthoped, Dept Spine Surg,State Key Lab Trauma & Chem Poison, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China; [He, Jian] Gen Hosp Western Theater Command, Pancreat Injury & Repair Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Lin, Si-En; Xu, Jian-Kun; Chang, Liang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Musculoskeletal Res Lab,Fac Med, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Li-Ming] Stanford Univ, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Dept Surg, Sch Med, Sacramento, CA 94305 USA; [Chen, Lin] Army Med Univ, Daping Hosp, Ctr Bone Metab & Repair, Res Inst Surg,State Key LabTrauma & Chem Poisoning, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jian-Xin] Army Med Univ, Daping Hosp, Wound Trauma Med Ctr, State Key Lab Trauma & Chem Poisoning, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China",Army Medical University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Prince of Wales Hospital; Stanford University; Army Medical University; Army Medical University,"Liu, P (corresponding author), Army Med Univ, Daping Hosp, Ctr Orthoped, Dept Spine Surg,State Key Lab Trauma & Chem Poison, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China.;Jiang, JX (corresponding author), Army Med Univ, Daping Hosp, Wound Trauma Med Ctr, State Key Lab Trauma & Chem Poisoning, Chongqing 400042, Peoples R China.",jiangjx@cta.cq.cn; liupengd@tmmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Sien/J-7773-2018","Lin, Sien/0000-0002-7292-7062",National Key Research and Development Program of China,National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),The authors are grateful to Dan-Ni Yue for her insightful suggestions on enhancing the graphical representations.,,226,3,3,27,30,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-7467,2054-9369,,MILITARY MED RES,MILITARY MED.

Over the period 1881-1911 the corporate form became the most common mode of business organisation for large businesses. As their number increased, the population of directors expanded and reflected an increasingly diversified corporate landscape. Based on a largescale dataset, this paper analyses the characteristics and networks of this wider population of directors. The study goes beyond previous work, which has mainly focused on elite directors or prominent companies, and shows three key findings. First, the population of directors was very connected into a large network, complete isolation from this network was rare. Second, over 1881-1911 director interlocks with banks became less important for most sectors, while interlocks with other financial institutions such as trusts became increasingly important. Insurance companies stood out as the most connected sector spanning smaller local companies and larger international ones. Third, during the period studied there was a shift from director clusters that were mainly based on proximity, to those that were connected through industries.",,,,Carry.van-lieshout@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,0,0,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1467-2227,1467-2235,,ENTERP SOC,Enterp.

EVIDENCE; INFORMATION; AMERICA; CENSOS; BANKS,"This article provides aggregate data on credit flows in Santafe de Bogota, the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (present-day Colombia, Ecuador and western Venezuela). By perusing a thorough report submitted to Bourbon authorities on notarial transactions, which included both ecclesiastical and non-ecclesiastical loans in the city, the article estimates the volume and size of lending activity while exploring how distinct types of credit interacted and shaped the business milieu of the region. It argues that by the late 1770s, Catholic Church lending had ceased to be the main source of investable funds in the region, with merchants and other non-ecclesiastical investors injecting growing funds into sectors traditionally avoided by ecclesiastical lenders such as commerce, mining and manufacturing. Network analysis suggests that merchants became brokers between different credit sources, alleviating information asymmetries and opening the credit market to borrowers with collateral and institutional restrictions willing to pay higher interest rates. Finally, by focusing on New Granada, the largest gold producer of the Spanish Empire, the article identifies some distinctive credit patterns that are different from those developed in silver-driven economies such as New Spain and Peru. Thus, the article provides new paths to study Latin American financial history.","[Granados, Oscar M.] Univ Jorge TadeoLozano, Dept Econ Finance & Commerce, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Torres, James V.] Univ Andes, Dept Hist & Geog, Bogota, DC, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Granados, OM (corresponding author), Univ Jorge TadeoLozano, Dept Econ Finance & Commerce, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",oscarm.granadose@utadeo.edu.co; jv.torres10@uniandes.edu.co,,,,,,,63,0,0,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0968-5650,1474-0052,,FINANC HIST REV,Financ.

Commuting patterns are highly linked to the spatial structure of functional districts in a city, which is substantially influenced by public transportation systems. Understanding urban mobility patterns are significant for revealing actual living districts and planning efficient transportation systems and infrastructure. This study aims to detect urban communities with spatially strong interaction based on similar mobility patterns. To extract homogeneous urban communities, we utilize a network community detection method, focusing on the multimodal transfer travels of the public transport system. As a case study, we examined urban communities in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea. The results showed newly detected living communities based on the actual mobility patterns of urban populations including multiple-choice behavior of transport mode. Such empirical findings depict more realistic dynamics of populations in large metropolitan areas and the significant influence of public transportation systems on urban mobility patterns.","[Kim, Jiwoo; Lee, Gunhak] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak-ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Gunhak] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Korean Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, G (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak-ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",gunhlee@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,61,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0160-0176,1552-6925,,INT REGIONAL SCI REV,Int.

Objectives: To construct a predictive model for inhibitor development in HA using a network of clinical variables and biomarkers based on the individual similarity network. Methods: Previously untreated and minimally treated children with severe/moderately severe HA, participants of the HEMFIL Cohort Study, were followed up until reaching 75 exposure days (EDs) without inhibitor (INH-) or upon inhibitor development (INH+). Clinical data and biological samples were collected before the start of factor (F) VIII replacement (T0). A predictive model (HemfilNET) was built to compare the networks and potential global topological differences between INH- and INH+ at T0, considering the network robustness. For validation, the leave-one-out cross- validation technique was employed. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used as evaluation metrics for the machine-learning model. Results: We included 95 children with HA (CHA), of whom 31 (33%) developed inhibitors. The algorithm, featuring 37 variables, identified distinct patterns of networks at T0 for INH+ and INH-. The accuracy of the model was 74.2% for CHA INH+ and 98.4% for INH-. By focusing the analysis on CHA with high-risk F8 mutations for inhibitor development, the accuracy in identifying CHA INH+ increased to 82.1%. Conclusion: Our machine-learning algorithm demonstrated an overall accuracy of 90.5% for predicting inhibitor development in CHA, which further improved when restricting the analysis to CHA with a high-risk F8 genotype. However, our model requires validation in other cohorts. Yet, missing data for some variables hindered more precise predictions.","[Jardim, Leticia Lemos] Inst Rene Rachou Fiocruz Minas, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Jardim, Leticia Lemos] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Schieber, Tiago A.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Ciencias Econ, Sch Econ, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Santana, Marcio Portugal; Chaves, Daniel Gonsalves] Fundacao Hemominas, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Cerqueira, Monica Hermida] Inst Hematol Arthur Siqueira Cavalcanti, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lorenzato, Claudia Santos] Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia Parana, Curitiba, Brazil; [Franco, Vivian Karla Brognoli] Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil; [Zuccherato, Luciana Werneck; Santos, Brendon Ayala da Silva; Rezende, Suely Meireles] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Ave Alfredo Balena 190,Room 255, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Ravetti, Martin Gomez] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Ciencia Computacao, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Rezende, SM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Ave Alfredo Balena 190,Room 255, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",suely.rezende@uol.com.br,"Lemos Jardim, Leticia/ABE-6261-2021","Lemos Jardim, Leticia/0000-0003-3358-0075; Schieber, Tiago/0000-0002-4923-7047","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES [88881.068041/2014-01]; CNPq [456080/2014-7, 28/2018]; Ministry of Health [25000.155761/2015-13]; FAPEMIG CDS [APQ-04185-10]; PPM FAPEMIG-2018; CAPES",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Ministry of Health; FAPEMIG CDS; PPM FAPEMIG-2018; CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"This work is supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES (Grant number 88881.068041/2014-01), CNPq (Grant number 456080/2014-7 and MCTIC No28/2018), Ministry of Health, Grant number 25000.155761/2015-13), and FAPEMIG CDS-(Grant number APQ-04185-10) and PPM FAPEMIG-2018.

Erythropoiesis is hierarchical in that it results from a series of cell fate decisions whereby hematopoietic stem cells progress toward the erythroid lineage. Single -cell transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have revolutionized the way we understand erythropoiesis, revealing it to be a gradual process that underlies a progressive restriction of fate potential driven by quantitative changes in lineage -specifying transcription factors. Despite these major advances, we still know very little about what cell fate decision entails at the molecular level. Novel approaches that simultaneously measure additional properties in single cells, including chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and/or cell surface proteins are being developed at a fast pace, providing the means to exciting new advances in the near future. In this review, we briefly summarize the main findings obtained from single -cell studies of erythropoiesis, highlight outstanding questions, and suggest recent technological advances to address them.

Data were collected during six oceanographic campaigns between 2005 and 2008, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment characterization and hydrological measurements. The first part of this comprehensive study was focused on the HPLC phytoplankton pigment dataset in relation to hydrological conditions. The research highlighted the importance of high-quality input data for accurate taxonomic analysis. Several unsupervised machine learning approaches, such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and network-based community detection analysis (NCA), were used to analyze the data and identify phytoplankton communities based on biomarker pigments. Five main phytoplankton communities were identified: diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, green algae, and cyanobacteria. The results evidenced distinct seasonal patterns, with diatom blooms dominating in spring, cyanobacterial blooms in mid-summer, and haptophyte and dinoflagellate peaks occurring in late summer and autumn. While PCA and NCA provided consistent insights into community structure, HCA offered less clarity in distinguishing between groups. The results of the statistical analysis were then compared with those of traditional approaches such as CHEMTAX and region-specific bio-optical algorithms, providing new perspectives on the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton groups. This study provides valuable insights into phytoplankton dynamics in the Baltic Sea and the effectiveness of different analytical approaches in understanding community structure, providing metrics that can enhance current and future advancements in remote sensing, including support for hyperspectral ocean color remote sensors.","[Canuti, Elisabetta] Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy; [Canuti, Elisabetta] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, Urbino, Italy; [Penna, Antonella] Univ Urbino, Dept Biomol Sci, Urbino, Italy; [Penna, Antonella] Natl Inter Univ Consortium Marine Sci, CoNISMa, Rome, Italy; [Penna, Antonella] Inter Inst Ctr Res Marine Biodivers Resources & Bi, Fano Marine Ctr, Fano, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Urbino; University of Urbino; CoNISMa,"Canuti, E (corresponding author), Joint Res Ctr JRC, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy.;Canuti, E (corresponding author), Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, Urbino, Italy.",elisabetta.canuti@ec.europa.eu,,,European Commission Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC); Copernicus Program,European Commission Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC); Copernicus Program,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Juvenile stages of dab (Limanda limanda), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea) present in the English Channel are common in the Seine estuary nursery grounds. To further explore the estuary's nursery function, we investigated the heterogeneity in spatial distribution patterns of these three flatfish at their juvenile stage, between 1996 and 2019. We used geostatistical indices and multivariate analyses to demonstrate species specific spatiotemporal dynamic. Sole favoured the most upstream part of the nursery, dab was found in the most marine areas, and plaice preferred the southern coast. We then performed clusters analysis based on spatial indices and spatial patterns extracted from a Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF). We showed that the average positions of the three flatfish species were stable across time. Each flatfish appeared to have its own spatial preference inside the nursery. No temporal variability in the spatial pattern nor trend was found that would correspond to the major stress imposed on the community by harbour development within the 2000-2005 period. We conclude that segregation of the juveniles of the three species within the nursery may reflect different ecological needs and underlying mechanisms to minimise interspecific competition.","[Cariou, Thibault; Dubroca, Laurent; Vogel, Camille] IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France; [Cariou, Thibault; Bez, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, IRD, CNRS,IFREMER, F-34200 Sete, France",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer,"Cariou, T (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France.",thibault.cariou@gmail.com,"Cariou, Thibault/LGZ-4145-2024; bez, nicolas/IXN-8686-2023; Dubroca, Laurent/AAS-5187-2021","Vogel, Camille/0000-0002-9590-5982; Dubroca, Laurent/0000-0002-1861-0507; Bez, Nicolas/0000-0002-3526-671X; Cariou, Thibault/0000-0002-7504-6439","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval; IFREMER","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); IFREMER","This work took place during the NOURSEINE project (2017-2019) , funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France.

Design/methodology/approach - The Scopus database was used to collect data on polymer 3D printing papers. This study uses bibliometric approach along with network analytic techniques to identify and discuss the most important countries and their scientific collaboration, compares income groups and analyses keyword trends. Findings - It was found that top research production results from heavy investments in research and development. The USA has the highest number of papers among the high-income countries. However, scientific production in the other two income groups is strongly dominated by China and India. Keyword analysis shows that countries with lower incomes in certain areas, such as composite and bioprinting, have fallen behind other groups over time. International collaborations were suggested as mechanisms for those countries to catch up with the current research trends. The evolution of the research field, which started with a focus on 3D printing processes and shifted to printed part designs and their applications, was discussed. The advancement of the research topic suggests that translational research on polymer 3D printing has been led mainly by research production from higher-income countries and countries with large research and development investments. Originality/value - Previous studies have conducted performance analysis, science mapping and network analysis in the field of 3D printing, but none have focused on global research trends classified by country income.

Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.","[Honnorat, Nicolas; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Saranathan, Manojkumar] Univ Arizona, Dept Med Imaging, Coll Med, 1501 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Sullivan, Edith, V; Pfefferbaum, Adolf; Pohl, Kilian M.; Zahr, Natalie M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",SRI International; University of Arizona; Stanford University,"Zahr, NM (corresponding author), SRI Int, Neurosci Program, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;Zahr, NM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 401 Quarry Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicolas.honnorat@sri.com; manojsar@radiology.arizona.edu; dolfp@stanford.edu; kilian.pohl@stanford.edu; nzahr@stanford.edu,"Saranathan, Manojkumar/O-4353-2019; Sullivan, Edith/ABD-5684-2021; Zahr, Natalie/W-5292-2019; Zahr, Natalie/L-7692-2016","Zahr, Natalie/0000-0002-3346-4894; Saranathan, Manoj/0000-0001-9020-9948; Pohl, Kilian/0000-0001-5416-5159; Sullivan, Edith/0000-0001-6739-3716","National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH113406]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH113406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [U01AA017347] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),"This study was supported with grant funding from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): R21 AA023582, R01 AA005965, U01 AA017347, R37 AA010723, and National Institute of Mental Health: R01 MH113406.",,114,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0376-8716,1879-0046,,DRUG ALCOHOL DEPEN,Drug Alcohol Depend.,MAR 1,2021,220.0,,,,,,,,108509,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108509,0.0,,JAN 2021,10,Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,QK3QW,33453503.0,Green Accepted,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000620296200008,0,Psychiatry

Transport impedance among ports through transit times and port infrastructures can, however, impact accessibility, trade performance, and the attractiveness of ports. Assessments of the transit routes between ports based on performance and attractiveness criteria can provide a topological liner shipping network that quantifies the performance profile of ports. Here, we constructed a directed global liner shipping network (GLSN) of the top six liner shipping companies between the ports of Africa, Asia, North/South America, Europe, and Oceania. Network linkages and community groupings were quantified through a container port accessibility evaluation model, which quantified the performance of the port using betweenness centrality, the transport impedance among ports with the transit time, and the performance of ports using the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index. The in-degree and out-degree of the GLSN conformed to the power-law distribution, respectively, and their R-square fitting accuracy was greater than 0.96. The community partition illustrated an obvious consistence with the actual trading flow. The accessibility evaluation result showed that the ports in Asia and Europe had a higher accessibility than those of other regions. Most of the top 30 ports with the highest accessibility are Asian (17) and European (10) ports. Singapore, Port Klang, and Rotterdam have the highest accessibility. Our research may be helpful for further studies such as species invasion and the planning of ports.","[Kang, Lu; Wu, Wenzhou; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kang, Lu; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Kang, Lu; Wu, Wenzhou; Yu, Hao; Su, Fenzhen] Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University","Wu, WZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wu, WZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",wuwz@lreis.ac.cn,"yu, hao/HIK-0596-2022","Yu, Hao/0000-0002-7647-1162; Su, Fenzhen/0000-0003-4972-3595; kang, lu/0000-0002-0223-1094",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42006171]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA13010403],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42006171) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA13010403).,,44,11,13,19,78,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2022,22.0,15,,,,,,,5889,10.3390/s22155889,0.0,,,15,Instruments & Instrumentation,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,3T2LW,35957447.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000840113400001,0,Instruments & Instrumentation

This graph analysis method projects a semantic value onto a given coordinated syntactic dependency and constructs a second-order lexical network of lexical collocates with a high co-occurrence measure. The subsequent process of clustering and pruning the graph reveals lexical communities with high conceptual similarity, which are interpreted as associated senses of the source lexeme. We demonstrate the theory and its application to the task of identifying the conceptual structure and different meanings of nouns, adjectives and verbs using examples from different corpora, and explain the modulating effects of linguistic and graph parameters. This graph approach is based on syntactic dependency processing and can be used as a complementary method to other contemporary natural language processing resources to enrich semantic tasks such as word disambiguation, domain relatedness, sense structure, identification of synonymy, metonymy, and metaphoricity, as well as to automate comprehensive meta-reasoning about languages and identify cross/intra-cultural discourse variations of prototypical conceptualization patterns and knowledge representations.

Analyzing 2481 posts from 154 undergraduate students across three sections of a communications course centered on discussions about movie clips or social phenomena to enhance media literacy, this research aims to interpret the interaction patterns in these virtual spaces. Traditional methods of group formation, such as teacher intervention and self-selection, often fail to create balanced and effective groups, especially in large online courses. The Louvain algorithm, known for its efficiency in modularity optimization, identifies clusters based on actual student interaction patterns. By leveraging both global and local network analyses, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of interaction structures. The global network analysis offers a macro view of overall interaction structures, revealing diverse patterns despite identical course designs, suggesting the influence of unique group dynamics. The local analysis, focusing on the intricacies of node and edge connections, underscores that the Louvain algorithm's classifications correlate with heightened cohesiveness and collaborative potential. The results indicate that algorithmically detected groups exhibit strong internal communication and cohesiveness, as evidenced by high clustering coefficients, density values, and weighted degrees. These findings underscore the potential of network analysis to optimize online student interactions, providing valuable insights for refining educational design to promote student engagement and collaborative problem-solving. This research highlights the transformative potential of integrating advanced data-driven techniques in educational technology to improve group formation and collaborative learning outcomes, offering empirical insights for educators to enhance online interactions and expand pedagogical understanding.","[Lee, Minkyung; Sharma, Priya] Penn State Univ, Dept Learning & Performance Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Lee, M (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Learning & Performance Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",minklee010@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2365-9440,,,INT J EDUC TECHNOL H,Int.

However, the existing approach is limited by its requirement of cell-type annotation as a necessary input, which can lead to unwanted technical variations. To overcome this limitation, a new kernel-based strategy is presented that models the structural composition of a niche as a continuous function in the gene expression space, thereby obviating the need for cell-type annotation. Further integration with cell-type deconvolution analysis extends its application to datasets with any spatial resolution. Applying this strategy to real datasets indicates enhanced performance in robustness and accuracy and provides new insights into injury or disease-associated tissue microenvironment changes.

We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment.

This heterogeneity can represent different ways in which psychological processes manifest, either between people or within a person across time. In many instances, those differences can have systematic patterns that can be related to future outcomes. In close relationships, for example, the daily exchange of affect between two individuals in a couple can contain a particular structure that is different across people and can result in varying levels of relationship satisfaction. In this paper we use Louvain, a clustering method, as a tool to characterize heterogeneity in multivariate time series data. Using affect measures from dyadic interactions, we first determine that Louvain is adept at detecting homogeneous patterns that are distinct from one another. Additionally, these homogeneous points are linked, at some level, by time. Thus, we find that clustering via Louvain is useful to find time periods of stable, reoccurring patterns. However, using measures founded on information theory reveals that there is some level of information loss that is inevitable when clustering on levels of variable expression. Finally, we evaluate the predictive validity of the clustering method by examining the relation between the identified clusters of affect and measures outside the time series (i.e., relationship satisfaction and breakup taken one and two years later).","[Aragones, Samuel D.; Ferrer, Emilio] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA USA; [Aragones, Samuel D.] Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Aragones, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, 200 E Quad, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sdaragones@ucdavis.edu,,"Aragones, Samuel/0000-0002-5071-797X; Ferrer, Emilio/0000-0001-7520-046X",,,,,56,0,0,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0027-3171,1532-7906,,MULTIVAR BEHAV RES,Multivariate Behav.

The model is compared to an ANN model using functional group counts and modularity as inputs. A dataset covering 430 molecules and temperature range between 253 and 463 K was employed to develop the models. The application of community detection resulted into 177 modules, which captured a wide range of molecular fragments and features, including polyfunctional molecules. The model was then reduced to 158 modules to improve performance considering statistical significance, correlation among inputs, relative importance in the ANN model and identification of outliers. The final modules model demonstrated improved performance on the training and test sets compared to the functional groups ANN model and showed excellent predictions for all compound classes. The model was then used to predict the viscosity of molecules potentially derived from biomass used in existing models, which served for further model validation. The final modules model showed improved performance based on the root mean squared error in comparison to existing models. This demonstrates the advantage of employing modularity and the modules identified by the community detection algorithm as molecular descriptors. The approach extends the potential of the application of community detection to molecular graphs and modularity to capture structure-property relationships for predicting molecular properties.","[Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Zenteno, Citlalli; Valencia, Diego; Aburto, Jorge] Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico",Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Martinez-Hernandez, E (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Petr, Biomass Convers Div, Mexico City 07730, Mexico.",emartinez@imp.mx,"Aburto, Jorge/AAR-7902-2021",,"Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) [540821111]; UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT [781507]; [Y.62001]","Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS); UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT));","This work was supported by a Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) grant, ID 540821111.

We study the evolutionary processes of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasars and the underlying physical processes, such as star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, through the application of Graph Theoretical analysis tools. We extract, process and analyze mid-infrared spectra of local (z < 0.4) ULIRGs and quasars between 5-38 mu m through internally developed Python routines, in order to generate similarity graphs, with the nodes representing ULIRGs being grouped together based on the similarity of their spectra. Additionally, we extract and compare physical features from the mid-IR spectra, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission and silicate depth absorption features, as indicators of the presence of star-forming regions and obscuring dust, in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of each evolutionary stage of ULIRGs. Our analysis identifies five groups of local ULIRGs based on their mid-IR spectra, which is quite consistent with the well established fork classification diagram by providing a higher level classification. We demonstrate how graph clustering algorithms and network analysis tools can be utilized as unsupervised learning techniques for revealing direct or indirect relations between various galaxy properties and evolutionary stages, which provides an alternative methodology to previous works for classification in galaxy evolution. Additionally, our methodology compares the output of several graph clustering algorithms in order to demonstrate the best-performing Graph Theoretical tools for studying galaxy evolution.

As large trophic networks cannot be simulated in their original size - it would be too computationally expansive - they are shrunk by aggregating species together. However, key species may get lumped during this process, masking their unique role in their ecosystem. Therefore, a more systematic understanding of the aggregation effects on key positions is needed. Here, we study how six aggregation methods change 24 importance indices used to find key species in food webs. Our work was carried out on 76 aquatic food webs from the Ecopath with Ecosim database (EcoBase). The aggregation methods we considered were: 1) hierarchical clustering with the Jaccard index; 2) hierarchical clustering with the REGE index; 3) clustering within classic food web modules, which we refer to as 'density-based' modules; 4) clustering within 'predator-based modules' in which species fed on the same preys; 5) clustering within 'prey-based modules' in which species are fed upon by the same predators; and 6) clustering within 'groups' in which species share the same probability to interact with other groups. Hierarchical clustering with the REGE index produced the best results. Therefore, we recommend using it if we were interested in maintaining the identity of key species. The other algorithms could also be used to study specific network processes. However, we need to consider the bias they produce when masking important species.","[Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Ctr Ecol Res, Budapest, Hungary; [Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Giacomuzzo, Emanuele] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Jordan, Ferenc] Cent European Univ, Democracy Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Jordan, Ferenc] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Ecological Research; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Central European University; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli,"Jordán, F (corresponding author), Cent European Univ, Democracy Inst, Budapest, Hungary.;Jordán, F (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy.",,"Jordan, Ferenc/A-9940-2009; Giacomuzzo, Emanuele/GVS-0262-2022","Giacomuzzo, Emanuele/0000-0003-2119-2163; Haugum, Siri Vatso/0000-0003-4958-7132",[SEP-210591007],,"FJ was supported by AtlantECO (H2020 BG-08-2018-2019, grant no.

Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and comparing variations in spatial arrangements within network geometries are of interest when explicit fracture representations or discrete fracture network models are chosen to capture the influence of fractures on bulk rock behaviour. Treating fracture networks as spatial graphs, we introduce a novel approach to quantify spatial variation. The method combines graph similarity measures with hierarchical clustering and is applied to investigate the spatial variation within large-scale 2-D fracture networks digitized from the well-known Lilstock limestone pavements, Bristol Channel, UK. We consider three large, fractured regions, comprising nearly 300 000 fractures spread over 14 200 m(2) from the Lilstock pavements. Using a moving-window sampling approach, we first subsample the large networks into subgraphs. Four graph similarity measures - fingerprint distance, D-measure, Network Laplacian spectral descriptor (NetLSD), and portrait divergence - that encapsulate topological relationships and geometry of fracture networks are then used to compute pair-wise subgraph distances serving as input for the statistical hierarchical clustering technique. In the form of hierarchical dendrograms and derived spatial variation maps, the results indicate spatial autocorrelation with localized spatial clusters that gradually vary over distances of tens of metres with visually discernable and quantifiable boundaries. Fractures within the identified clusters exhibit differences in fracture orientations and topology. The comparison of graph similarity-derived clusters with fracture persistence measures indicates an intranetwork spatial variation that is not immediately obvious from the ubiquitous fracture intensity and density maps. The proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify spatial variations in fracture networks, guiding stochastic and geostatistical approaches to fracture network modelling.","[Prabhakaran, Rahul; Bertotti, Giovanni] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Prabhakaran, Rahul; Smeulders, David] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Urai, Janos] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Struct Geol Tecton & Geomech, Aachen, Germany",Delft University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology; RWTH Aachen University,"Prabhakaran, R (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Delft, Netherlands.;Prabhakaran, R (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",r.prabhakaran@tudelft.nl,"Prabhakaran, Rahul/P-6864-2019; Urai, Janos/A-2226-2013","Urai, Janos L./0000-0001-5299-6979",,,,,67,8,8,1,12,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1869-9510,1869-9529,,SOLID EARTH,Solid Earth,SEP 30,2021,12.0,10,,,,,2159,2209,,10.5194/se-12-2159-2021,0.0,,,51,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics,WB9UH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-01-26,WOS:000703910100001,0,Geochemistry & Geophysics

Transport impedance among ports through transit times and port infrastructures can, however, impact accessibility, trade performance, and the attractiveness of ports. Assessments of the transit routes between ports based on performance and attractiveness criteria can provide a topological liner shipping network that quantifies the performance profile of ports. Here, we constructed a directed global liner shipping network (GLSN) of the top six liner shipping companies between the ports of Africa, Asia, North/South America, Europe, and Oceania. Network linkages and community groupings were quantified through a container port accessibility evaluation model, which quantified the performance of the port using betweenness centrality, the transport impedance among ports with the transit time, and the performance of ports using the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index. The in-degree and out-degree of the GLSN conformed to the power-law distribution, respectively, and their R-square fitting accuracy was greater than 0.96. The community partition illustrated an obvious consistence with the actual trading flow. The accessibility evaluation result showed that the ports in Asia and Europe had a higher accessibility than those of other regions. Most of the top 30 ports with the highest accessibility are Asian (17) and European (10) ports. Singapore, Port Klang, and Rotterdam have the highest accessibility.

Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the limitations of the method and perspectives for future research.","[Blondel, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Guillaume, Jean-Loup] La Rochelle Univ, L3i, La Rochelle, France; [Lambiotte, Renaud] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Lambiotte, Renaud] Turing Inst, London, England",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Oxford,"Lambiotte, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Lambiotte, R (corresponding author), Turing Inst, London, England.",vincent.blondel@uclouvain.be; jean-loup.guillaume@univ-lr.fr; renaud.lambiotte@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Lambiotte, Renaud/HDO-4530-2022",,"EPSRC [EP/V013068/1, EP/V03474X/1]; ANR MITIK project; French National Research Agency (ANR) [PRC AAPG2019]","EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ANR MITIK project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Agence nationale pour le developpement de la recherche en sante (ANDRS)Agence Nationale Des Plantes Medicinales Et Aromatiques, ANPMA, Morocco); French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD)","The work of R L was supported by the EPSRC Grants EP/V013068/1 and EP/V03474X/1.

Possible combinations of money laundering actions and schemes are analysed through a holistic visualisation to draw policy-relevant insights into their prevention.MethodsA prior scoping review of money laundering typologies identified 793 activities that a money launderer can take to obfuscate illicit funds. These actions form the basis of a directed network graph showcasing all possible combinations of money laundering schemes. Three network-based analyses are then conducted: (1) centrality analysis, to determine the most 'important' money laundering actions as priorities for prevention, (2) resilience analysis to simulate iterative interventions against different money laundering actions to assess their impact on the wider network and (3) subgroup analysis to identify groups of commonly undertaken schemes (i.e. typologies).ResultsMoney laundering is found to be a highly resilient process crime, with specific interventions often unable to prevent schemes from displacing to alternative activities to launder their funds. However, benefits of tactically displacing criminals to more easily detectable schemes are discussed. The formulation of money laundering typologies through more empirically robust processes is also motivated, in place of compartmentalised reports that remain the current standard practice.ConclusionsNetwork analysis is motivated as an effective way of visualising complex process crimes with vast criminal opportunities such as money laundering, allowing policy-relevant insights to be drawn in terms of resource-allocation, strategy and prioritisation. Theoretical and policy implications of the current study are discussed in the context of crime scientific theories.","[Akartuna, Eray Arda] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Li Dak Sam Yip Yio Chin Acad Bldg LI, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Johnson, Shane D.; Thornton, Amy] Univ Coll London UCL, Dept Secur & Crime Sci, 35 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England",City University of Hong Kong; University of London; University College London,"Akartuna, EA (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Li Dak Sam Yip Yio Chin Acad Bldg LI, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",arda.akartuna@cityu.edu.hk,,"Akartuna, Eray Arda/0000-0002-2724-0819",Dawes Centre for Future Crime at UCL,Dawes Centre for Future Crime at UCL,Open access publishing enabled by City University of Hong Kong Library's agreement with Springer Nature.

In this context, this paper reports on a study for the detection of hidden communities and influential users on social networks through the analysis of Twitter posts during Brazil mega oil fields auction in 2019. We use a methodology focused on identifying relevant users for the target community and discovering the effects of interactions between interest groups based on the modeling of the oil and gas social network. Firstly, we applied a standard community detection algorithm called Louvain method. Next, we used the Herfindahl-Hirschman index to identify the most influential users in the network by measuring the distribution of users' influence in a community. As a result, it was possible to visualize the presence of clusters and specific topics of interest shared by the most influential communities. Moreover, it was also possible to distinguish the convergent and divergent opinions that permeated the pre-salt auction and the level of Twitter engagement of key players from the global energy market.","[Rubin, Francis Spiegel; Alvim, Adriana C.

Many disciplines such as design, planning, scheduling, and manufacturing execution need to be carefully engineered and coordinated to create successful product assembly plans. Recent research in the field of design for assembly has proposed new methodologies to design product structures in such a way that their assembly is easier. However, present assembly planning approaches lack the engineering tool support to capture all the constraints associated to assembly planning in a unified manner. This paper proposes COMPOSITIONALPLANNING, a string diagram based framework for assembly planning. In the proposed framework, string diagrams and their compositional properties serve as the foundation for an engineering tool where CAD designs interact with planning and scheduling algorithms to automatically create high-quality assembly plans. These assembly plans are then executed in simulation to measure their performance and to visualize their key build characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach in the LEGO assembly domain. We developed two reference LEGO CAD models that are processed by COMPOSITIONALPLANNING'S algorithmic pipeline. We compare sequential and parallel assembly plans in a Minecraft simulation and show that the time-to-build performance can be optimized by our algorithms.","[Master, Jade] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; [Patterson, Evan] Stanford Univ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yousfi, Shahin; Canedo, Arquimedes] Siemens Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Stanford University; Siemens AG; Siemens USA,"Canedo, A (corresponding author), Siemens Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jmast003@ucr.edu; evan@epatters.org; arquimedes.canedo@siemens.com,,"Master, Jade/0000-0003-1970-6030; Patterson, Evan/0000-0002-8600-949X",,,,,30,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-54249-8; 978-3-030-54248-1,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2020,12169.0,,,,,,167,183,,10.1007/978-3-030-54249-8_14,0.0,,,17,Logic,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BS3JG,,,,,2025-01-26,WOS:000711951500014,0,Logic

However, these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies generate an extraordinary amount of data, which creates analysis and interpretation challenges. Additionally, scRNA-seq datasets often contain technical sources of noise owing to incomplete RNA capture, PCR amplification biases and/or batch effects specific to the patient or sample. If not addressed, this technical noise can bias the analysis and interpretation of the data. In response to these challenges, a suite of computational tools has been developed to process, analyse and visualize scRNA-seq datasets. Although the specific steps of any given scRNA-seq analysis might differ depending on the biological questions being asked, a core workflow is used in most analyses. Typically, raw sequencing reads are processed into a gene expression matrix that is then normalized and scaled to remove technical noise. Next, cells are grouped according to similarities in their patterns of gene expression, which can be summarized in two or three dimensions for visualization on a scatterplot. These data can then be further analysed to provide an in-depth view of the cell types or developmental trajectories in the sample of interest. This Review provides the non-expert reader with an overview of the different steps involved in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. The authors also provide insight into the strengths and pitfalls of available analysis tools.","[Wu, Yan; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Zhang, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kzhang@bioeng.ucsd.edu,"Zhang, Kun/ABE-6349-2020","Zhang, Kun/0000-0002-7596-5224","NIH [U01MH098977, R01HL123755, U54HL145608, UH3DK114933, R01HG009285]",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The authors were supported by NIH grants U01MH098977, R01HL123755, U54HL145608, UH3DK114933 and R01HG009285.",,109,71,83,3,76,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1759-5061,1759-507X,,NAT REV NEPHROL,Nat.

Despite the recent focus on dimensionality assessment in network psychometrics, unidimensionality assessment remains a challenge. Community detection algorithms are the most common approach to estimate dimensionality in networks. Many community detection algorithms maximize an objective criterion called modularity. A limitation of modularity is that it penalizes unidimensional structures in networks, favoring two or more communities (dimensions). In this study, this penalization is discussed and a solution is offered. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation using one- and two-factor models is performed. Key to the simulation was the condition of model error or the misfit of the population factor model to the generated data. Based on previous simulation studies, several community detection algorithms that have performed well with unidimensional structures (Leading Eigenvalue, Leiden, Louvain, and Walktrap) were compared. A grid search was performed on the tunable parameters of these algorithms to determine the optimal trade-off between unidimensional and bidimensional recovery. The best-performing parameters for each algorithm were then compared against each other as well as maximum likelihood factor analysis and parallel analysis (PA) with mean and 95th percentile eigenvalues. Overall, the Leiden and Louvain algorithms and PA methods were the most accurate methods to recover unidimensional and bidimensional structures and were the most robust to model error. More nuanced method recommendations for specific unidimensional and bidimensional conditions are provided.","[Christensen, Alexander P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol & Human Dev, Peabody 552,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Christensen, AP (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol & Human Dev, Peabody 552,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",alexpaulchristensen@gmail.com,,"Christensen, Alexander/0000-0002-9798-7037",,,,,65,0,0,2,2,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1082-989X,1939-1463,,PSYCHOL METHODS,Psychol.

Social media enable universities, but also academics and institutions affiliated with them, to expand their communication. This leads to increasing plurivocality of universities, yet the many different voices remain largely unexplored. This study develops a typology to conceptually distinguish eight voices by their representational role, hierarchical embeddedness, type, and affiliation. Based on a quantitative content and social network analysis of more than 600 Twitter accounts linked to a research university, it identifies six types of voices empirically. The study compares interactions among these voices, showing differences between central and decentral, as well as institutional and individual voices, and highlighting closer exchanges between voices within the same disciplinary communities. It also examines topics and tonality, revealing that decentral institutional voices engage most in science-related topics, and that only current and former students express critical views.","[Volk, Sophia Charlotte; Furst, Silke; Schafer, Mike S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Vogler, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Res Ctr Publ Sphere & Soc Fog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schafer, Mike S.] Univ Zurich, Sci Commun, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Volk, SC (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res IKMZ, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",s.volk@ikmz.uzh.ch,"Volk, Sophia/AAE-6285-2021; Schafer, Mike/F-7238-2010","Vogler, Daniel/0000-0002-0211-7574; Schafer, Mike/0000-0002-0847-7503; Volk, Sophia Charlotte/0000-0003-0887-8224; Furst, Silke/0000-0002-1978-4277",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [184992],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) (grant agreement no. 184992).",,54,0,0,12,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0963-6625,1361-6609,,PUBLIC UNDERST SCI,Public Underst.

Across 143 healthy, community-dwelling adults 19-79 years of age, we estimated structural network properties from diffusion-weighted imaging and functional network properties from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We confirmed previous reports of age-related decline in the strength and efficiency of structural networks, as well as in the connectivity strength within and between structural network modules. Functional networks, in contrast, exhibited age-related decline only in system segregation, a measure of the distinctiveness among network modules. Aging was associated with decline in a composite measure of fluid cognition, particularly tests of executive function. Functional system segregation was a significant mediator of age-related decline in executive function. Structural network properties did not directly influence the age-related decline in functional system segregation. The raw correlational data underlying the graph theoretical measures indicated that structural connectivity exerts a limited constraint on age-related decline in functional connectivity.

Objectives: To construct a predictive model for inhibitor development in HA using a network of clinical variables and biomarkers based on the individual similarity network. Methods: Previously untreated and minimally treated children with severe/moderately severe HA, participants of the HEMFIL Cohort Study, were followed up until reaching 75 exposure days (EDs) without inhibitor (INH-) or upon inhibitor development (INH+). Clinical data and biological samples were collected before the start of factor (F) VIII replacement (T0). A predictive model (HemfilNET) was built to compare the networks and potential global topological differences between INH- and INH+ at T0, considering the network robustness. For validation, the leave-one-out cross- validation technique was employed. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used as evaluation metrics for the machine-learning model. Results: We included 95 children with HA (CHA), of whom 31 (33%) developed inhibitors. The algorithm, featuring 37 variables, identified distinct patterns of networks at T0 for INH+ and INH-. The accuracy of the model was 74.2% for CHA INH+ and 98.4% for INH-. By focusing the analysis on CHA with high-risk F8 mutations for inhibitor development, the accuracy in identifying CHA INH+ increased to 82.1%. Conclusion: Our machine-learning algorithm demonstrated an overall accuracy of 90.5% for predicting inhibitor development in CHA, which further improved when restricting the analysis to CHA with a high-risk F8 genotype. However, our model requires validation in other cohorts. Yet, missing data for some variables hindered more precise predictions.","[Jardim, Leticia Lemos] Inst Rene Rachou Fiocruz Minas, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Jardim, Leticia Lemos] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Schieber, Tiago A.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Ciencias Econ, Sch Econ, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Santana, Marcio Portugal; Chaves, Daniel Gonsalves] Fundacao Hemominas, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Cerqueira, Monica Hermida] Inst Hematol Arthur Siqueira Cavalcanti, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lorenzato, Claudia Santos] Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia Parana, Curitiba, Brazil; [Franco, Vivian Karla Brognoli] Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil; [Zuccherato, Luciana Werneck; Santos, Brendon Ayala da Silva; Rezende, Suely Meireles] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Ave Alfredo Balena 190,Room 255, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Ravetti, Martin Gomez] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Ciencia Computacao, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Rezende, SM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Ave Alfredo Balena 190,Room 255, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",suely.rezende@uol.com.br,"Lemos Jardim, Leticia/ABE-6261-2021","Lemos Jardim, Leticia/0000-0003-3358-0075; Schieber, Tiago/0000-0002-4923-7047","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES [88881.068041/2014-01]; CNPq [456080/2014-7, 28/2018]; Ministry of Health [25000.155761/2015-13]; FAPEMIG CDS [APQ-04185-10]; PPM FAPEMIG-2018; CAPES",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Ministry of Health; FAPEMIG CDS; PPM FAPEMIG-2018; CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"This work is supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil-CAPES (Grant number 88881.068041/2014-01), CNPq (Grant number 456080/2014-7 and MCTIC No28/2018), Ministry of Health, Grant number 25000.155761/2015-13), and FAPEMIG CDS-(Grant number APQ-04185-10) and PPM FAPEMIG-2018.

As an emerging biotechnology, single-cell transcriptomics has been gradually applied in diverse aspects of animal research, offering an effective method to study the gene expression of high-throughput single cells of different tissues/organs in animals. In an unprecedented manner, researchers have identified cell types/subtypes and their marker genes, inferred cellular fate trajectories, and revealed cell-cell interactions in animals using single-cell transcriptomics. In this paper, we introduce the development of single-cell technology and review the processes, advancements, and applications of single-cell transcriptomics in animal research. We summarize recent efforts using single-cell transcriptomics to obtain a more profound understanding of animal nutrition and health, reproductive performance, genetics, and disease models in different livestock species. Moreover, the practical experience accumulated based on a large number of cases is highlighted to provide a reference for determining key factors (e.g., sample size, cell clustering, and cell type annotation) in single-cell transcriptomics analysis. We also discuss the limitations and outlook of single-cell transcriptomics in the current stage.

We design several quantum variants of a popular classical algorithm - the Louvain algorithm for community detection - and first study their complexities in the usual way, before analysing their complexities empirically across a variety of artificial and real inputs. We find that this analysis yields insights not available to us via the asymptotic analysis, further emphasising the utility in such an empirical approach. In particular, we observe that a complicated quantum algorithm with a large asymptotic speedup might not be the fastest algorithm in practice, and that a simple quantum algorithm with a modest speedup might in fact be the one that performs best. Moreover, we repeatedly find that overheads such as those arising from the need to amplify the success probabilities of quantum sub-routines such as Grover search can nullify any speedup that might have been suggested by a theoretical worst- or expected-case analysis.","[Cade, Chris; Folkertsma, Marten; Niesen, Ido; Weggemans, Jordi] QuSoft, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cade, Chris; Niesen, Ido] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Folkertsma, Marten; Weggemans, Jordi] CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cade, Chris] Fermioniq, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Cade, C (corresponding author), QuSoft, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Cade, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Cade, C (corresponding author), Fermioniq, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,"QuSoft [QuantAlgo 680-91-034]; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK), as part of the Quantum Delta NL programme; ABN AMRO; QuSoft; CWI [680-91-034]","QuSoft; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK), as part of the Quantum Delta NL programme; ABN AMRO; QuSoft; CWI","CC was supported by QuantERA project QuantAlgo 680-91-034, with further funding provided by QuSoft and CWI.

Juvenile stages of dab (Limanda limanda), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea) present in the English Channel are common in the Seine estuary nursery grounds. To further explore the estuary's nursery function, we investigated the heterogeneity in spatial distribution patterns of these three flatfish at their juvenile stage, between 1996 and 2019. We used geostatistical indices and multivariate analyses to demonstrate species specific spatiotemporal dynamic. Sole favoured the most upstream part of the nursery, dab was found in the most marine areas, and plaice preferred the southern coast. We then performed clusters analysis based on spatial indices and spatial patterns extracted from a Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF). We showed that the average positions of the three flatfish species were stable across time. Each flatfish appeared to have its own spatial preference inside the nursery. No temporal variability in the spatial pattern nor trend was found that would correspond to the major stress imposed on the community by harbour development within the 2000-2005 period. We conclude that segregation of the juveniles of the three species within the nursery may reflect different ecological needs and underlying mechanisms to minimise interspecific competition.","[Cariou, Thibault; Dubroca, Laurent; Vogel, Camille] IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France; [Cariou, Thibault; Bez, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, IRD, CNRS,IFREMER, F-34200 Sete, France",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer,"Cariou, T (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Manche Mer du Nord, Lab Ressources Halieut, F-14520 Port En Bessin, France.",thibault.cariou@gmail.com,"Cariou, Thibault/LGZ-4145-2024; bez, nicolas/IXN-8686-2023; Dubroca, Laurent/AAS-5187-2021","Vogel, Camille/0000-0002-9590-5982; Dubroca, Laurent/0000-0002-1861-0507; Bez, Nicolas/0000-0002-3526-671X; Cariou, Thibault/0000-0002-7504-6439","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval; IFREMER","European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France; Region de Haute-Normandie prefecture; Autonomous Harbour of Le Havre; LITEAU program; Seine-Aval program; GIP Seine-Aval(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); IFREMER","This work took place during the NOURSEINE project (2017-2019) , funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and France Filie`re Peche (FFP) , France.
